abstract = {Haptic technologies can open up new avenues for assisting older people in their daily activities, in particular in navigation and orientation tasks. A number of haptic wearables have already proven their usefulness for younger individuals. However, older adults' specific needs for a haptic navigation aid have seldom been investigated. The same is valid for the design of haptic patterns that would be both acceptable and efficient for the elderly. This paper is a contribution in this direction. It is focused on the design of a set of haptic patterns for and by the elderly. It presents the user evaluation that was conducted to assess the recognition rate of these patterns during a navigation task in an urban environment. Fourteen elderly participants took part in the study. The results showed that repetitions of a sequence within a pattern were not crucial for their discrimination and recall. On the contrary, they can cause memorization difficulties and confusion. We discuss these results and propose a number of recommendations for the design of haptic patterns adapted to the older adults' needs.},

abstract = {In spite of the availability of journey planners, too many occasional travellers are distressed when facing the complexity of public transportation networks in large cities. So are regular travellers in case of unexpected perturbations. The haptic modality offers a discrete, eyes-free and ear-free channel of communication that can provide useful information to assist users in their travel. This paper presents the metaphor-based and user-centric methodology used to develop the haptic interaction (hardware and haptic patterns). It led to the design of haptic patterns based on user requirements and tested with a custom tactile wrist bracelet. The evaluation shows that patterns were very well recognized in mobility with limited training and reached a good satisfaction level, thus validating the methodology grounded on metaphors and participatory design. Moreover, the results pointed out user differences in perceiving patterns and raised the need to tune the patterns according to the users' choice.},

abstract = {Haptic technology has been widely employed in applications ranging from teleoperation and medical simulation to art and design, including entertainment, flight simulation, and virtual reality. Today there is a growing interest among researchers in integrating haptic feedback into audiovisual systems. A new medium emerges from this effort: haptic-audiovisual (HAV) content. This paper presents the techniques, formalisms, and key results pertinent to this medium. We first review the three main stages of the HAV workflow: the production, distribution, and rendering of haptic effects. We then highlight the pressing necessity for evaluation techniques in this context and discuss the key challenges in the field. By building on existing technologies and tackling the specific challenges of the enhancement of audiovisual experience with haptics, we believe the field presents exciting research perspectives whose financial and societal stakes are significant.},

We especially consider the case of a first-person point of view audiovisual content and we propose a general workflow to address this problem. This latter includes a novel approach to both capture the motion and video of the scene of interest, together with a haptic rendering system for generating a sensation of motion. A complete methodology to evaluate the relevance of our framework is finally proposed and demonstrates the interest of our approach.},

abstract = {Haptics, the technology which brings tactile or force-feedback to users, has a great potential for enhancing movies and could lead to new immersive experiences. This article introduces haptic cinematography, which presents haptics as a new component of the filmmaker's toolkit. The authors propose a taxonomy of haptic effects and introduce new effects coupled with classical cinematographic motions to enhance the video-viewing experience. They propose two models to render haptic effects based on camera motions: the first model makes the audience feel the motion of the camera, and the second provides haptic metaphors related to the semantics of the camera effect. Results from a user study suggest that these new effects improve the quality of experience. Filmmakers can use this new way of creating haptic effects to propose new immersive audio-visual experiences.},

abstract = {The continuous evolution of computer haptics, as well as the emergence of a wide range of haptic interfaces has recently boosted the haptics domain. Even though efficient tools that support the developer's work exist, little attention is paid to the reuse and compatibility of haptic application constituents. In response to these issues, we propose an XML-based description language, namely Haptic Application Meta Language - HAML. HAML is designed to provide a technology-neutral description of haptic models. It contains ergonomic requirements and specifications for haptic hardware and software interactions. The envisioned goal is to allow for the creation of plug-and-play environments in which a wide array of supported haptic devices can be used in a multitude of virtual environments, with the compatibility issues being handled by automated engines instead of programmatically by the user. As per implementation, MPEG-7 standard has been used to instantiate HAML schema through the use of description schemes (DS). Our preliminary experimentation demonstrates the suitability of HAML for solving the compatibility issue},

The tool's features include various methods for creating new icons including direct recording of manual trajectories and creation from a choice of basis waveforms; novel direct-manipulation icon editing mechanisms, integrated playback and convenient storage of icons to file.

@article{Gallace2010,
abstract = {Surprisingly little scientific research has been conducted on the topic of interpersonal touch over the years, despite the importance of touch in our everyday social interactions from birth through to adulthood and old age. In this review, we critically evaluate the results of the research on this topic that have emerged from disciplines, such as cognitive and social psychology, neuroscience, and cultural anthropology. We highlight some of the most important advances to have been made in our understanding of this topic: For example, research has shown that interpersonal tactile stimulation provides an effective means of influencing people's social behaviors (such as modulating their tendency to comply with requests, in affecting people's attitudes toward specific services, in creating bonds between couples or groups, and in strengthening romantic relationships), regardless of whether or not the tactile contact itself can be remembered explicitly. What is more, interpersonal touch can be used to communicate emotion in a manner similar to that demonstrated previously in vision and audition. The recent growth of studies investigating the potential introduction of tactile sensations to long-distance communication technologies (by means of mediated or ‘virtual' touch) are also reviewed briefly. Finally, we highlight the synergistic effort that will be needed by researchers in different disciplines if we are to develop a more complete understanding of interpersonal touch in the years to come.},

abstract = {Nowadays the World Wide Web increasingly provides rich multimedia contents to its users. With the support of HTML5 techniques and haptic plug-ins for browsers, haptic enabled content can be realized over the Web. However, it is not easy for Web designers that are not proficient in programming or scripting languages (such as javascript), and who do not possess basic knowledge regarding haptics, to add and modify haptic content. Also, it is currently not possible to describe and reuse a well-described haptic- enabled Web application with 3D graphics in a browser. In this paper, we present an MPEG-V based authoring tool for haptics- enabled Web applications and games implemented in HTML5. This tool provides an interface for users to create and export haptic-enabled 3D scenes in a standard MPEG-V format which can be reconstructed in a Web haptic player. The proposed system is comprised of two components: the authoring tool interface, and an MPEG-V based Web haptic player.},

abstract = {Amplitude-modulated vibrotactile stimuli have been broadly used for tactile perception and rendering research. However, understandings of the perceptual relations between amplitude-modulated vibrations are not comprehensive yet. In this paper, we present a perceptual analysis on the identifying characteristics of amplitude-modulated vibrations and their perceptual relations. We estimated the perceptual dissimilarities among one carrier and seven amplitude-modulated sinusoidal vibrations (150-Hz carrier frequency; seven modulation frequencies in 1-80 Hz) in a psychophysical experiment. The dissimilarity scores were inspected using multi-dimensional scaling to obtain an appropriate perceptual space. The optimal perceptual space was two-dimensional, where the vibration points exhibited a circular formation. The analysis showed that the pulse-like low-frequency sensation of an amplitude-modulated vibration increased for very low modulation frequencies (1-10 Hz), then decreased for higher modulation frequencies (10-80 Hz), and eventually converged to the smooth vibrational sensation of the 150-Hz carrier signal. It also suggested that the envelope waveform is primary information for the discrimination of amplitude-modulated signals, instead of their spectral energy distributions. These findings can contribute to the design of perceptually salient and distinctive vibrotactile signals using amplitude modulation.},

abstract = {With new technologies such as body sensors, tangible interaction, haptics, interactive cloth, or small computing devices such as mobiles, we can move interaction from the desktop out into the world and onto our bodies. Likewise, with the boom of computer games, domestic digital technology use, and social communication tools, we have to consider designing for non-instrumental goals, beyond task completion. This has been picked up by human-computer interaction researchers in the so-called third wave of HCI. We suggest that learning technologies could use some of the results from the third wave of HCI, placing body and emotion more centrally into the communication and construction of knowledge. Designing for bodily interaction, emotional communication or aesthetics is not trivial. In design work, a designer can only set the stage for certain experience to happen, but in the end, it is the user who co-constructs the experience with or through the interaction. Based on our experiences of designing for bodily and emotional communication, we will posit three postulates that might be helpful in designing for involving interaction: leaving dasiasurfacespsila open for users to appropriate, building for users to recognise themselves socially, emotional or bodily through the interface, and avoiding reductionism.},

abstract = {In a previous study, we found that the accuracy of human haptic perception of force direction is not very high. We also found an effect of physical force direction on the error subjects made, resulting in ‘error patterns'. In the current study, we assessed the between- and within-subject variation of these patterns. The within-subject variation was assessed bymeasuring the error patterns repeatedly over time for the same set of subjects. Many of these patterns were correlated, which indi- cates that they are fairly stable over time and thus subject-specific. The between-subject analysis, conversely, yielded hardly any significant corre- lations.We also measured general subject parameters that might explain this between-subject variation, but these parameters did not correlate with the error patterns. Concluding, we found that the error patterns of haptic perception of force direction are subject-specific and probably governed by an internal subject parameter that we did not yet discover.

Effect of naming haptic icons






Note: only difference was in rhythm, this was short-term learning with a difficult task



*awesome related work for hapticon design, and descriptive language of other senses*


BETWEEN-subjects


Levels: No names
Pre-selected non-descriptive names
Self-selected names


Metrics: Identifying Stimuli in non-verbal matching test
Remembering stimulus names


Hypotheses:
H1: Self-selected most identifiable
H2: Self-selected more memorable names than non-descriptive names
H3: Remembering names improves identification


Results: H1: No difference in condition in identifying the icons
H2: Self-selected more memorable and best for middle learning (no other differences in learning)
H3: Not supported


Participants expected that having names (in the no-names condition) or having better names (in other conditions) would improve results (70{\%} and 60{\%} respectively)},

The requirements for this display are that it can be worn on a mobile operator, is light weight and robust. Two tactile vests are being developed to meet these objectives, one based on small electric motors and the other on contractile shape-memory alloy (SMA) fibers. Four electromechanical actuators were evaluated for use in the vest and a small vibration motor was selected for the initial prototype. A 3×3 array was fabricated for psychophysical testing and positioned on the lower back. High accuracy in perceiving the direction of factor activation was achieved by all subjects in this task. A factor array based on SMA actuators was fabricated and tested and results indicate that this low-bandwidth device can generate tactile inputs on the torso that are perceptible.},

This article presents a fully automated framework of generating tactile cues from streaming images to provide synchronized visuotactile stimuli in real time. The spatiotemporal features of video images are analyzed on the basis of visual saliency and then mapped into the tactile cues that are rendered on tactors installed on a chair. We also conducted two user experiments for performance evaluation. The first experiment investigated the effects of visuotactile rendering against visual-only rendering, demonstrating that the visuotactile rendering improved the movie watching experience to be more interesting, immersive, and understandable. The second experiment was performed to compare the effectiveness of authoring methods and found that the automated authoring approach, used with care, can produce plausible tactile effects similar in quality to manual authoring.},

We propose that the initial representation of sparsely contacted layout is kinesthetic. From this can be computed a configural representation that supports reports of shape and scale, but at the cost of increased error. In four experiments, participants' fingers were guided to a two-point layout, after which they returned to the points or reported distance and/or angle, subject to a change in location and sometimes a rotation as well. Errors in reproducing inter-point distance, i.e., the scale of the layout, were smallest for the task of returning to the touched points and nearly twice as great when distance was reported at a new location. Errors in reproducing inter-point angle, i.e., the shape of the layout, were smallest for the task of returning to the touched points and nearly twice as great when angle was reported subject to rotation. The data highlight limitations on reporting the shape and scale of a haptically rendered layout after sparse contact.},

abstract = {The path of design thinking is filled with various idea-fragments (Baya 1996; Meinel and Leifer 2011; Sonalkar 2012). One of the core challenges faced by design-thinking teams is to navigate through this sea of fragments, to keep all fragments in their sights while constantly testing alternative configurations in pursuit of a concept worth investing in. During each design thinking operation, we are certain to face challenges. One important finding in all design thinking research projects is that deep design thinking is a synthesis challenge more than it is an ideation challenge. The path is constantly being molded and re-shaped by events and findings. Several steps along the way are sure to be different than on any previous search. Way finding is an adventure that enthrals the design thinker and the researchers who observe closely. In time we face a moment in which a clear path forward unfolds. It is that point in the cycle where synthesis and divergent thinking, analysis and convergent thinking, and the nature of the problem all come together and resolution has been captured. In Design Thinking processes there is no solitary action or procedure that actually defines the process. There are as many different design processes as there are design thinkers.},

abstract = {Two experiments establish links between desired knowledge about objects and hand movements during haptic object exploration. Experiment 1 used a match-to-sample task, in which blindfolded subjects were directed to match objects on a particular dimension (e.g., texture). Hand movements during object exploration were reliably classified as “exploratory procedures,” each procedure defined by its invariant and typical properties. The movement profile, i.e., the distribution of exploratory procedures, was directly related to the desired object knowledge that was required for the match. Experiment 2 addressed the reasons for the specific links between exploratory procedures and knowledge goals. Hand movements were constrained, and performance on various matching tasks was assessed. The procedures were considered in terms of their necessity, sufficiency, and optimality of performance for each task. The results establish that in free exploration, a procedure is generally used to acquire information about an object property, not because it is merely sufficient, but because it is optimal or even necessary. Hand movements can serve as “windows,” through which it is possible to learn about the underlying representation of objects in memory and the processes by which such representations are derived and utilized.},

abstract = {Thresholds for sensation of continuous sinusoidal skin displacements were determined in 7 different test points in the glabrous skin area of the right hand of 11 human subjects. While the subjects were tracking the threshold, the frequency of the sine wave was continuously varied between 0.8 Hz and 400 Hz. The obtained threshold-frequency functions showed systematic differences between test points at frequencies below 40–60 Hz. These differences were closely related to density in the skin of the afferent mechanoreceptive units most likely accounting for the decisive afferent signals. At higher frequencies, the interregional variation was less marked whereas there was a pronounced variation between subjects. It was proposed that the detection of the type of stimuli used was based on activity in 3 different mechanoreceptive systems.},

However, design of haptic information displays is eased by the availability of design parameters that can be smoothly modulated along a continuous dimension. Taking guidance from visual and auditory media design, we identified and validated a perceptually successful ldquomorphrdquo function that modulates a tactile vibration between two disparate endpoints (a square and a triangle or sine wave), by varying the magnitude of the vertical (highest frequency content) component of the waveform. This finding suggests a specific psychonomic function related to frequency perception, points towards a practical utility in haptic information design, and supports reflections on further possibilities for haptic morphing.},

@article{Milot2010,
abstract = {Performance errors drive motor learning for many tasks. Some researchers have suggested that reducing performance errors with haptic guidance can benefit learning by demonstrating correct movements, while others have suggested that artificially increasing errors will force faster and more complete learning. This study compared the effect of these two techniques--haptic guidance and error amplification--as healthy subjects learned to play a computerized pinball-like game. The game required learning to press a button using wrist movement at the correct time to make a flipper hit a falling ball to a randomly positioned target. Errors were decreased or increased using a robotic device that retarded or accelerated wrist movement, based on sensed movement initiation timing errors. After training with either error amplification or haptic guidance, subjects significantly reduced their timing errors and generalized learning to untrained targets. However, for a subset of more skilled subjects, training with amplified errors produced significantly greater learning than training with the reduced errors associated with haptic guidance, while for a subset of less skilled subjects, training with haptic guidance seemed to benefit learning more. These results suggest that both techniques help enhanced performance of a timing task, but learning is optimized if training subjects with the appropriate technique based on their baseline skill level.},

Our experiences with one potentially powerful approach, Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) analysis of perceptual data acquired using an efficient cluster sorting technique, raised questions relating to the methodology for data collection. In this paper, we review key issues relating to perceptual data collection method, describe an example data set and present its initial MDS analysis, and then examine the impact of collection method on MDS outcome through a secondary analysis of the data and the inherent structure of the algorithm components. Our analysis suggests that an understanding of these issues is important for the method's effective use, but has not exposed any major flaws with the process.},

A well-known issue is interpreting the map's geocentric content, which is known to become prone to errors when the map is not aligned to the environment. In this paper we report our investigation of providing a cue about the destination's location from an egocentric perspective in order to improve the interpretation of the map. We used a vibrotactile belt to continuously indicate a destination's direction relative to the user's orientation. In an outdoor field study we compared the performance of map-based navigation with and without the added tactile cue. We found evidence that people take shorter routes, consult the map less often, and were less often disoriented with the tactile cue. Furthermore, females found the tactile cue more useful and used it more often.},

However, in unexplored environments or when otherwise engaged, a greater awareness of surroundings or higher cognitive loads are required. We propose HaptiGo, a lightweight haptic vest that provides pedestrians both navigational intelligence and obstacle detection capabilities. HaptiGo consists of optimally-placed vibrotactile sensors that utilize natural and small form factor interaction cues, thus emulating the invisible sensation of being passively guided towards the intended direction. We evaluated HaptiGo through a study conducted on a group of pedestrians, whom were tasked with navigating through several different waypoints while engaged in cognitively demanding tasks. We found that HaptiGo was able to successfully navigate users with timely alerts of incoming obstacles without increasing cognitive load, thereby increasing their environmental awareness. Additionally, we show that users are able to respond to directional information without training.},

Ss were asked to describe in detail each of 3 geometric figures drawn on cards so that the experimenter, not looking at the figure, "would know exactly how it looked." Two figures were illusions, but the 3rd (of an equally complex figure) was not. Half of the Ss were presented the control figure first, the other half saw it last. Qualitative differences were found between the Ss' reaction to the illusory and nonillusory stimuli. Although only 3 of 30 Ss maneuvered the control figure as they described it, 14 and 17 Ss in the other groups maneuvered the 2 illusory figures. Significant verbal differences were also found. It is concluded that illusions represent "ambivalent" forms of organization that create unresolved perceptual tension and do not allow for "progressive determination" of their essential character.

abstract = {The vibration motor is an actuator widely used for generating vibrations in haptic interaction, virtual reality, human-computer interaction, and gaming. Whereas the vibration motor has many advantages such as low price and small size, its internal structure brings a critical limitation: its output has correlated amplitude and frequency both controlled by voltage applied to the motor. Using the absolute magnitude estimation paradigm in psychophysics, we have previously obtained an Input-Output (I/O) relation from the applied voltage to vibration magnitude perceived by the user. Based on its inverse I/O relation, this paper addresses a vibration rendering method that allows the user to command the vibration motor in a perceptually transparent manner. Using the rendering method, the effects of vibration commands (in voltage) on the user's percept can be correctly understood, allowing more effective vibration design for haptic interaction. We have also implemented a prototype graphical vibration editor into which the perceptually transparent vibration rendering method is incorporated. The vibration editor can assist the user to easily design vibration effects for the vibration motor as s/he manipulates sounds with a graphical audio editor and to clearly predict the user's percept induced from the resulting vibrations as well.},
annote = {***NOTE: only works for voltage-controlled rumble motors and intensity***


General approach is a good idea (model transformation from voltage to perceptual space, then design in perceptual space, use inverse transformation to find voltage).


Actually pretty light on technical details. Trace through references to find details on measuring the perceptual space or coming up with the transform.


Also has a light authoring tool.},

abstract = {Affective response may dominate users' reactions to the synthesized tactile sensations that are proliferating in today's handheld and gaming devices, yet it is largely unmeasured, modeled or characterized. A better understanding of user perception will aid the design of tactile behavior that engages touch, with an experience that satisfies rather than intrudes. We measured 30 subjects' affective response to vibrations varying in rhythm and frequency, then examined how differences in demographic, everyday use of touch, and tactile processing abilities contribute to variations in affective response. To this end, we developed five affective and sensory rating scales and two tactile performance tasks, and also employed a published `Need for Touch' (NFT) questionnaire. Subjects' ratings, aggregated, showed significant correlations among the five scales and significant effect of the signal content (rhythm and frequency). Ratings varied considerably among subjects, but this variation did not coincide with demographic, NFT score or tactile task performance. The linkages found among the rating scales confirm this as a promising approach. The next step towards a comprehensive picture of individuals' patterns of affective response to tactile sensations entails pruning, integration and redundancy reduction of these scales, then their formal validation.},

abstract = {This work aims to demonstrate and explain a nearly century old electrostatic haptic effect in human fingertips, which has since gone unreported. This effect, based on the original work of Johnsen and Rahbek [1], as well as research on electrostatic chucking devices [2], is capable of producing electrostatic forces on the finger an order of magnitude greater than those previously reported in literature. It is also capable of working with DC excitation, an aspect which stands out against previous reports which utilize purely AC excitation. This work also proposes a unified force model for this effect, drawn from electrostatic chuck research, and resolves this model with those in previous reports. We briefly discuss the background and specifics of the Johnsen-Rahbek effect, and include measurements made with our own electroadhesive surface and experimental apparatus. Finally, we discuss how this model fits in with previous observations, and its implications going forward.},

@article{VanDerMeijden2009,
abstract = {Background: Virtual reality (VR) as surgical training tool has become a state-of-the-art technique in training and teaching skills for minimally invasive surgery (MIS). Although intuitively appealing, the true benefits of haptic (VR training) platforms are unknown. Many questions about haptic feedback in the different areas of surgical skills (training) need to be answered before adding costly haptic feedback in VR simulation for MIS training. This study was designed to review the current status and value of haptic feedback in conventional and robot-assisted MIS and training by using virtual reality simulation. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was undertaken using PubMed and MEDLINE. The following search terms were used: Haptic feedback OR Haptics OR Force feedback AND/OR Minimal Invasive Surgery AND/OR Minimal Access Surgery AND/OR Robotics AND/OR Robotic Surgery AND/OR Endoscopic Surgery AND/OR Virtual Reality AND/OR Simulation OR Surgical Training/Education. Results: The results were assessed according to level of evidence as reflected by the Oxford Centre of Evidence-based Medicine Levels of Evidence. Conclusions: In the current literature, no firm consensus exists on the importance of haptic feedback in performing minimally invasive surgery. Although the majority of the results show positive assessment of the benefits of force feedback, results are ambivalent and not unanimous on the subject. Benefits are least disputed when related to surgery using robotics, because there is no haptic feedback in currently used robotics. The addition of haptics is believed to reduce surgical errors resulting from a lack of it, especially in knot tying. Little research has been performed in the area of robot-assisted endoscopic surgical training, but results seem promising. Concerning VR training, results indicate that haptic feedback is important during the early phase of psychomotor skill acquisition.},

@article{Weber2013,
abstract = {When we run our fingers over the surface of an object, we acquire information about its microgeometry and material properties. Texture information is widely believed to be conveyed in spatial patterns of activation evoked across one of three populations of cutaneous mechanoreceptive afferents that innervate the fingertips. Here, we record the responses evoked in individual cutaneous afferents in Rhesus macaques as we scan a diverse set of natural textures across their fingertips using a custom-made rotating drum stimulator. We show that a spatial mechanism can only account for the processing of coarse textures. Information about most natural textures, however, is conveyed through precise temporal spiking patterns in afferent responses, driven by high-frequency skin vibrations elicited during scanning. Furthermore, these texture-specific spiking patterns predictably dilate or contract in time with changes in scanning speed; the systematic effect of speed on neuronal activity suggests that it can be reversed to achieve perceptual constancy across speeds. The proposed temporal coding mechanism involves converting the fine spatial structure of the surface into a temporal spiking pattern, shaped in part by the mechanical properties of the skin, and ascribes an additional function to vibration-sensitive mechanoreceptive afferents. This temporal mechanism complements the spatial one and greatly extends the range of tangible textures. We show that a combination of spatial and temporal mechanisms, mediated by all three populations of afferents, accounts for perceptual judgments of texture.},

abstract = {This paper is concerned with emotional responses of tactile icons. Using three sets of tactile icons in which four physical parameters-amplitude, frequency, duration, and envelope-were systematically varied, we estimated their valence and arousal scores in a perceptual experiment with 24 participants. Results showed that the four parameters have clear relationships to the emotional responses of tactile icons. Our tactile icons spanned to a large region in the valence-arousal space, but they did not elicit very positive-relaxing or very negative-relaxing emotional responses. These findings provide the design guidelines of tactile icons that have desired emotional properties.},
