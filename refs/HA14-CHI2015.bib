abstract = {The feasibility of communicating pictorial information through the skin has been demonstrated. A tactile television system has permitted blind subjects to determine the position, size, shape, and orientation of visible objects and to track moving targets. The system comprises 1) a vidicon camera utilizing a zoom lens, 2) a digital switching matrix to sequentially connect each element of the photocathode surface through a single video amplifier and signal conditioner to each of the 3) 400 tactile stimulators in a 20 \~{A}? 20 matrix in contact with a 10-inch square of skin. This image-projector matrix impresses on the skin a two-dimensional vibrating facsimile of either the silhouette or the outline of a visible object. The single-channel swept system exhibits inherent economies when a great number of picture elements is to be processed. Since the fovea of the human eye subserving the central two degrees of detailed vision is comprised of cone cells in a matrix about 200 receptors across, the present 20-line system permits picture transmission with a linear resolution about one-tenth that of the fovea, and has proved adequate for the recognition of human faces. Calculations indicate that the input capacity of the skin of the trunk should compare favorably with that of the fovea. We have determined the electrical-stimulus parameters for painless stimulation of the sensation of mechanical vibration with small electrodes in a closely spaced matrix.},

That this use should be good for people--easy, effective, efficient, and enjoyable--is a principal goal of design. In this book, we present the notion of Conceptual Models, and argue that Conceptual Models are core to achieving good design. From years of helping companies create software applications, we have come to believe that building applications without Conceptual Models is just asking for designs that will be confusing and difficult to learn, remember, and use. We show how Conceptual Models are the central link between the elements involved in application use: people's tasks (task domains), the use of tools to perform the tasks, the conceptual structure of those tools, the presentation of the conceptual model (i.e., the user interface), the language used to describe it, its implementation, and the learning that people must do to use the application.

Two tactile vests are being developed to meet these objectives, one based on small electric motors and the other on contractile shape-memory alloy (SMA) fibers. Four electromechanical actuators were evaluated for use in the vest and a small vibration motor was selected for the initial prototype. A 3×3 array was fabricated for psychophysical testing and positioned on the lower back. High accuracy in perceiving the direction of factor activation was achieved by all subjects in this task. A factor array based on SMA actuators was fabricated and tested and results indicate that this low-bandwidth device can generate tactile inputs on the torso that are perceptible.},

The vibrotactile score is adapted from common musical scores and preserves the metaphor of musical scores for easy learning. In this paper, we investigate the usability of the vibrotactile score, focusing on its learnability, efficiency, and user preference. Experiment I was to compare the vibrotactile score and the current dominant practice of vibrotactile pattern design using programming or scripting. The results gained from programming experts validated the substantially superior performance of the vibrotactile score. Experiment II compared the vibrotactile score with waveform-based design implemented in a few recent graphical authoring tools. Regular users without programming backgrounds participated in this experiment, and the results substantiated the improved performance of the vibrotactile score.},

	Compared VibScoreEditor to programming
	Expert users (defined as senior/grad CS students, programming experts but no previous exposure to vibrotactile pattern design)
	Participants had basic familiarity with  musical scores and symbols
	C (complete sample progrram) and XML (templates)

	    C always slowest
	    VSE rated as more intuitive  than other two
	    VSE preferred sometimes, often not stat. sig.
	    Large indiv. differences in time taken

In this paper, we introduce a vibrotactile score, an effective means for composing vibrotactile patterns. The vibrotactile score is a metaphor of the musical score to vibrotaction, and its design is adapted from two common musical scores (the piano score and the guitar tablature). Moreover, we developed an authoring tool, vibrotactile score editor (VibScoreEditor), that fully supports the vibrotactile score with intuitive graphical user interface. Another metaphorical feature, vibrotactile clef (analogous to the musical clef), is incorporated in the editor to make the process of composing vibrotactile patterns decoupled from the process of considering the signal-level characteristics of vibration. A few examples of vibrotactile patterns designed using the VibScoreEditor are also presented.},

abstract = {The use of haptic devices is becoming widespread, particularly with their growth in the home-games market and on mobile phones. Likewise, the number of haptic devices and APIs is increasing. However, it is still difficult to program and develop haptic applications. Consequently, there is a need to hide the complexity of programming a haptic application or interactions by providing prototyping tools or frameworks. In particular, one growing application area is haptic data visualization (also called haptification): the use of haptic devices to represent and realize information and data. This paper presents a visual prototyping tool for haptic interactions for data visualization. Users can easily and quickly create haptic interactions through a visual programming interface with tunable parameters. This paper also presents a user evaluation aimed at demonstrating that non-programmers can create simple haptic interactions and which also indicates potential improvements to the tool.},

The multi-channel timeline interface is also developed for designing time-synchronized multiple vibrotactile patterns for multiple vibration motors. In addition, an internal vibration player is incorporated to allow the user to test and evaluate designed patterns immediately. The last unique feature is a module for perceptually transparent rendering that can guarantee the delivery of perceptually correct vibration effects.

abstract = {Vibrotactile (VT) signals are found today in many everyday electronic devices (e.g., notification of cellphone messages or calls); but it remains a challenge to design engaging, understandable vibrations to accommodate a broad range of preferences. Here, we examine customization as a way to leverage the affective qualities of vibrations and satisfy diverse tastes; specifically, the desirability and composition of VT customization tools for end-users. A review of existing design and customization tools (haptic and otherwise) yielded five parameters in which such tools can vary: 1) size of design space, 2) granularity of control, 3) provided design framework, 4) facilitated parameter(s), and 5) clarity of design alternatives. We varied these parameters within low-fidelity prototypes of three customization tools, modeled in some respects on existing popular examples. Results of a Wizard-of-Oz study confirm users' general interest in customizing everyday VT signals. Although common in consumer devices, choosing from a list of presets was the least preferred, whereas an option allowing users to balance VT design control with convenience was favored. We report users' opinion of the three tools, and link our findings to the five characterizing parameters for customization tools that we have proposed.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the feasibility of creating spatially moving vibrotactile sensations using two vibrotactile actuators in a mobile device. The idea is based on well-known tactile illusions of apparent tactile motion and \^{A}¿phantom\^{A}¿ sensation. The phantom sensation refers to a perceptual phenomenon where spatially separated vibrotactile actuators that stimulate different skin zones induce a single tactile sensation midway between the two stimulation points. We tested whether such sensation can also be elicited in a mobile device via a psychophysical experiment that employed an open response paradigm. Experimental conditions differed in vibration rendering method, signal duration, and sensation movement direction. The subjects answered the perceived positions and intensities of vibrotactile sensations by drawing graphs with respect to time. The results demonstrated that such \^{A}¿vibrotactile flow\^{A}¿ can be reliably produced in a mobile device and that a performance trade-off exists depending on the method and signal duration used for rendering. The findings of this paper can be applied to the user interface design of a mobile device with enriched vibrotactile sensations and an improved information transfer bandwidth.},
