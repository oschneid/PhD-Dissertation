abstract = {Computer haptics (CH) and computer vision (CV) are two popular research areas among researchers. Despite their increasing in popularity, little has been reported on integrating both techniques in CV into CH. At present, researchers mainly work on either CH or CV topics, separately. Combining these two areas may benefit information retrieval as the existence of haptic information could enhance a particular search. This paper describes how both CV and CH could be applied into our proposed search engine framework for searching fabric textures. The framework developed involves a computer vision algorithm and a haptic rendering algorithm. Based on our experiments that include searching algorithm and haptic rendering, the result shows that computer vision algorithm can be applied into and suitable for generating haptic textures. This leads towards obtaining a haptic texture search engine that enables cloth searching not only visually but also haptically.},

The second study aims at understanding on which ground designers of different levels of expertise construct their own constrained cognitive environment.

@article{Collins1970,
abstract = {The feasibility of communicating pictorial information through the skin has been demonstrated. A tactile television system has permitted blind subjects to determine the position, size, shape, and orientation of visible objects and to track moving targets. The system comprises 1) a vidicon camera utilizing a zoom lens, 2) a digital switching matrix to sequentially connect each element of the photocathode surface through a single video amplifier and signal conditioner to each of the 3) 400 tactile stimulators in a 20 \~{A}? 20 matrix in contact with a 10-inch square of skin. This image-projector matrix impresses on the skin a two-dimensional vibrating facsimile of either the silhouette or the outline of a visible object. The single-channel swept system exhibits inherent economies when a great number of picture elements is to be processed. Since the fovea of the human eye subserving the central two degrees of detailed vision is comprised of cone cells in a matrix about 200 receptors across, the present 20-line system permits picture transmission with a linear resolution about one-tenth that of the fovea, and has proved adequate for the recognition of human faces. Calculations indicate that the input capacity of the skin of the trunk should compare favorably with that of the fovea. We have determined the electrical-stimulus parameters for painless stimulation of the sensation of mechanical vibration with small electrodes in a closely spaced matrix.},

abstract = {Texture gives real objects an important perceptual dimension that is largely missing from virtual haptic interactions due to limitations of standard modeling and rendering approaches. This paper presents a set of methods for creating a haptic texture model from tool-surface interaction data recorded by a human in a natural and unconstrained manner. The recorded high-frequency tool acceleration signal, which varies as a function of normal force and scanning speed, is segmented and modeled as a piecewise autoregressive (AR) model. Each AR model is labeled with the source segment's median force and speed values and stored in a Delaunay triangulation to create a model set for a given texture. We use these texture model sets to render synthetic vibration signals in real time as a user interacts with our TexturePad system, which includes a Wacom tablet and a stylus augmented with a Haptuator. We ran a human-subject study with two sets of ten participants to evaluate the realism of our virtual textures and the strengths and weaknesses of this approach. The results indicated that our virtual textures accurately capture and recreate the roughness of real textures, but other modeling and rendering approaches are required to completely match surface hardness and slipperiness.},

This article introduces haptic cinematography, which presents haptics as a new component of the filmmaker's toolkit. The authors propose a taxonomy of haptic effects and introduce new effects coupled with classical cinematographic motions to enhance the video-viewing experience. They propose two models to render haptic effects based on camera motions: the first model makes the audience feel the motion of the camera, and the second provides haptic metaphors related to the semantics of the camera effect. Results from a user study suggest that these new effects improve the quality of experience. Filmmakers can use this new way of creating haptic effects to propose new immersive audio-visual experiences.},

Together they provide a general introduction to haptic interfaces, their construction, and application design. Haptic interfaces comprise hardware and software components aiming at providing computer-controlled, programmable sensations of mechanical nature, i.e., pertaining to the sense of touch. In Part I, we describe methods that have been researched and developed to date to achieve the generation of haptic sensations, the means to construct experimental devices of modest complexity, and the software components needed to drive them. In Part II of this series, we will describe some basic concepts of haptic interaction design together with several interesting applications based on this technology.},

The touch-sensitive surface of the sleeve consists of a grid of 4×3 sensor compartments filled with conductive wool. Each compartment controls the vibration intensity of a vibration motor, located in a grid of 4×3 motors beneath the touch-sensitive layer.

@book{Hutchins1995,
abstract = {Edwin Hutchins combines his background as an anthropologist and an open ocean racing sailor and navigator in this account of how anthropological methods can be combined with cognitive theory to produce a new reading of cognitive science. His theoretical insights are grounded in an extended analysis of ship navigation - its computational basis, its historical roots, its social organization, and the details of its implementation in actual practice aboard large ships. The result is an unusual interdisciplinary approach to cognition in culturally constituted activities outside the laboratory - "in the wild." Hutchins examines a set of phenomena that have fallen in the cracks between the established disciplines of psychology and anthropology, bringing to light a new set of relationships between culture and cognition. The standard view is that culture affects the cognition of individuals. Hutchins argues instead that cultural activity systems have cognitive properties of their own that are different from the cognitive properties of the individuals who participate in them. Each action for bringing a large naval vessel into port, for example, is informed by culture: the navigation team can be seen as a cognitive and computational system. Introducing Navy life and work on the bridge, Hutchins makes a clear distinction between the cognitive properties of an individual and the cognitive properties of a system. In striking contrast to the usual laboratory tasks of research in cognitive science, he applies the principal metaphor of cognitive science - cognition as computation (adopting David Marr's paradigm) - to the navigation task. After comparing modern Western navigation with the method practiced in Micronesia, Hutchins explores the computational and cognitive properties of systems that are larger than an individual. He then turns to an analysis of learning or change in the organization of cognitive systems at several scales. Hutchins's conclusion illustrates the costs of ignoring the cultural nature of cognition, pointing to the ways in which contemporary cognitive science can be transformed by new meanings and interpretations.},

That this use should be good for people--easy, effective, efficient, and enjoyable--is a principal goal of design. In this book, we present the notion of Conceptual Models, and argue that Conceptual Models are core to achieving good design. From years of helping companies create software applications, we have come to believe that building applications without Conceptual Models is just asking for designs that will be confusing and difficult to learn, remember, and use. We show how Conceptual Models are the central link between the elements involved in application use: people's tasks (task domains), the use of tools to perform the tasks, the conceptual structure of those tools, the presentation of the conceptual model (i.e., the user interface), the language used to describe it, its implementation, and the learning that people must do to use the application. We further show that putting a Con...},

Two tactile vests are being developed to meet these objectives, one based on small electric motors and the other on contractile shape-memory alloy (SMA) fibers. Four electromechanical actuators were evaluated for use in the vest and a small vibration motor was selected for the initial prototype. A 3×3 array was fabricated for psychophysical testing and positioned on the lower back. High accuracy in perceiving the direction of factor activation was achieved by all subjects in this task. A factor array based on SMA actuators was fabricated and tested and results indicate that this low-bandwidth device can generate tactile inputs on the torso that are perceptible.},

abstract = {The extent to which the addition of haptic communication between human users in a shared virtual environment (SVE) contributes to the shared experience of the users has not received much attention in the literature. In this paper we describe a demonstration of and an experimental study on haptic interaction between two users over a network of significant physical distance and a number of network hops. A number of techniques to mitigate instability of the haptic interactions induced by network latency are presented. An experiment to evaluate the use of haptics in a collaborative situation mediated by a networked virtual environment is examined. The experimental subjects were to cooperate in lifting a virtual box together under one of four conditions in a between-groups design. Questionnaires were used to report the ease with which they could perform the task and the subjective levels of presence and copresence experienced. This extends earlier work by the authors to consider the possibility of haptic collaboration under real network conditions with a number of improvements. Using the technology described in this paper, transatlantic touch was successfully demonstrated between the Touch Lab at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA and Virtual Environments and Computer Graphics (VECG) lab at University College London (UCL), UK in 2002. It was also presented at the Internet II demonstration meeting in 2002 between University of Southern California and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

Previously, we proposed a vibrotactile score as an intuitive and effective approach for vibrotactile pattern design. The vibrotactile score is adapted from common musical scores and preserves the metaphor of musical scores for easy learning. In this paper, we investigate the usability of the vibrotactile score, focusing on its learnability, efficiency, and user preference. Experiment I was to compare the vibrotactile score and the current dominant practice of vibrotactile pattern design using programming or scripting. The results gained from programming experts validated the substantially superior performance of the vibrotactile score. Experiment II compared the vibrotactile score with waveform-based design implemented in a few recent graphical authoring tools. Regular users without programming backgrounds participated in this experiment, and the results substantiated the improved performance of the vibrotactile score.},

In this paper, we introduce a vibrotactile score, an effective means for composing vibrotactile patterns. The vibrotactile score is a metaphor of the musical score to vibrotaction, and its design is adapted from two common musical scores (the piano score and the guitar tablature). Moreover, we developed an authoring tool, vibrotactile score editor (VibScoreEditor), that fully supports the vibrotactile score with intuitive graphical user interface. Another metaphorical feature, vibrotactile clef (analogous to the musical clef), is incorporated in the editor to make the process of composing vibrotactile patterns decoupled from the process of considering the signal-level characteristics of vibration. A few examples of vibrotactile patterns designed using the VibScoreEditor are also presented.},

Haptic interactions employ mechanical, programmed physical devices that can be used for human-computer communication via the sense of touch. In Part I of this series, we focused on the devices themselves: the classes of hardware schemes currently available or envisioned, the software components that drive them, and specific examples that can be built on the kitchen table. Here in Part II, we broach a topic that is coming into its own; between the vision of a particular utility that haptic feedback theoretically should enable and the hardware capable of delivering the required sensations is the problem of designing the interaction in a usable way.},

abstract = {In an attentionally overloaded world, relief will come only from interfaces between humans and computation that are able to provide information in the background of our sensory and cognitive processes. Haptic displays may have a special role to play in this emerging movement toward ambient interfaces, because the touch sense is well suited to present many types of information in a way that treads lightly on our mental resources. This paper offers an introduction to the notion of ambient information display, and explores why and how the haptic channel could contribute. It begins with a discussion of the attentional problems posed by contemporary interface technology, and a broad overview of ambient interfaces themselves: their purpose, specification, features, and some general examples. Sense is made of the haptic ambient design space through a morphology of the functionality and social configurations exhibited by existing and envisioned examples. Finally, reflections on design principles and challenges for ambient haptic interfaces are aimed at inspiring, shaping, and informing future development in this area.},

abstract = {This paper reviews studies on the tactile dimensionality of physical properties of materials in order to determine a common structure for these dimensions. Based on the commonality found in a number of studies and known mechanisms for the perception of physical properties of textures, we conclude that tactile textures are composed of three prominent psychophysical dimensions that are perceived as roughness/smoothness, hardness/softness, and coldness/warmness. The roughness dimension may be divided into two dimensions: macro and fine roughness. Furthermore, it is reasonable to consider that a friction dimension that is related to the perception of moistness/dryness and stickiness/slipperiness exists. Thus, the five potential dimensions of tactile perception are macro and fine roughness, warmness/coldness, hardness/softness, and friction (moistness/dryness, stickiness/slipperiness). We also summarize methods such as psychological experiments and mathematical approaches for structuring tactile dimensions and their limitations.},

abstract = {The use of haptic devices is becoming widespread, particularly with their growth in the home-games market and on mobile phones. Likewise, the number of haptic devices and APIs is increasing. However, it is still difficult to program and develop haptic applications. Consequently, there is a need to hide the complexity of programming a haptic application or interactions by providing prototyping tools or frameworks. In particular, one growing application area is haptic data visualization (also called haptification): the use of haptic devices to represent and realize information and data. This paper presents a visual prototyping tool for haptic interactions for data visualization. Users can easily and quickly create haptic interactions through a visual programming interface with tunable parameters. This paper also presents a user evaluation aimed at demonstrating that non-programmers can create simple haptic interactions and which also indicates potential improvements to the tool.},

Vibration patterns are managed in a database using XML formats in order to improve their reusability and extensibility. The multi-channel timeline interface is also developed for designing time-synchronized multiple vibrotactile patterns for multiple vibration motors. In addition, an internal vibration player is incorporated to allow the user to test and evaluate designed patterns immediately. The last unique feature is a module for perceptually transparent rendering that can guarantee the delivery of perceptually correct vibration effects. The authoring tool is suitable to mobile devices that contain a single vibration motor as well as applications in virtual reality and haptics that frequently employ multiple vibration motors.},

abstract = {It is widely believed that verbal processing generally improves memory performance. However, in a series of six experiments, verbalizing the appearance of previously seen visual stimuli impaired subsequent recognition performance. In Experiment 1, subjects viewed a videotape including a salient individual. Later, some subjects described the individual's face. Subjects who verbalized the face performed less well on a subsequent recognition test than control subjects who did not engage in memory verbalization. The results of Experiment 2 replicated those of Experiment 1 and further clarified the effect of memory verbalization by demonstrating that visualization does not impair face recognition. In Experiments 3 and 4 we explored the hypothesis that memory verbalization impairs memory for stimuli that are difficult to put into words. In Experiment 3 memory impairment followed the verbalization of a different visual stimulus: color. In Experiment 4 marginal memory improvement followed the verbalization of a verbal stimulus: a brief spoken statement. In Experiments 5 and 6 the source of verbally induced memory impairment was explored. The results of Experiment 5 suggested that the impairment does not reflect a temporary verbal set, but rather indicates relatively long-lasting memory interference. Finally, Experiment 6 demonstrated that limiting subjects' time to make recognition decisions alleviates the impairment, suggesting that memory verbalization overshadows but does not eradicate the original visual memory. This collection of results is consistent with a recoding interference hypothesis: verbalizing a visual memory may produce a verbally biased memory representation that can interfere with the application of the original visual memory.},

abstract = {Vibrotactile (VT) signals are found today in many everyday electronic devices (e.g., notification of cellphone messages or calls); but it remains a challenge to design engaging, understandable vibrations to accommodate a broad range of preferences. Here, we examine customization as a way to leverage the affective qualities of vibrations and satisfy diverse tastes; specifically, the desirability and composition of VT customization tools for end-users. A review of existing design and customization tools (haptic and otherwise) yielded five parameters in which such tools can vary: 1) size of design space, 2) granularity of control, 3) provided design framework, 4) facilitated parameter(s), and 5) clarity of design alternatives. We varied these parameters within low-fidelity prototypes of three customization tools, modeled in some respects on existing popular examples. Results of a Wizard-of-Oz study confirm users' general interest in customizing everyday VT signals. Although common in consumer devices, choosing from a list of presets was the least preferred, whereas an option allowing users to balance VT design control with convenience was favored. We report users' opinion of the three tools, and link our findings to the five characterizing parameters for customization tools that we have proposed.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the feasibility of creating spatially moving vibrotactile sensations using two vibrotactile actuators in a mobile device. The idea is based on well-known tactile illusions of apparent tactile motion and \^{A}¿phantom\^{A}¿ sensation. The phantom sensation refers to a perceptual phenomenon where spatially separated vibrotactile actuators that stimulate different skin zones induce a single tactile sensation midway between the two stimulation points. We tested whether such sensation can also be elicited in a mobile device via a psychophysical experiment that employed an open response paradigm. Experimental conditions differed in vibration rendering method, signal duration, and sensation movement direction. The subjects answered the perceived positions and intensities of vibrotactile sensations by drawing graphs with respect to time. The results demonstrated that such \^{A}¿vibrotactile flow\^{A}¿ can be reliably produced in a mobile device and that a performance trade-off exists depending on the method and signal duration used for rendering. The findings of this paper can be applied to the user interface design of a mobile device with enriched vibrotactile sensations and an improved information transfer bandwidth.},

Haptic icon design involves the envisioning, expression and iterative modification of haptic behavior representations. These behaviors are then rendered on a haptic device. For example, a sinusoidal force vs. position representation rendered on a haptic knob would produce the feeling of detents. Our contribution is twofold. We introduce a custom haptic icon prototyper that includes novel interaction features, and we then use the lessons learnt from its development plus our experiences with a variety of haptic devices to present and argue high-level design choices for such prototyping tools in general.},

abstract = {Vibrotactile feedback is strongly influenced by both accompanying audio and video feedback. Nevertheless, most tools and techniques focus on haptics in isolation during prototyping. We present the ViviTouch® Studio as a novel research tool that facilitates rapid prototyping of audio + video + vibrotactile feedback. Our tool also demonstrates a multimodal rapid prototyping architecture process that works on most operating systems and devices without custom embedded controllers or real-time operating systems. Easy A/B comparisons between different actuators, such as eccentric rotating masses, linear resonant actuators, piezoelectric elements, voice coils and electroactive polymers, are supported.},
annote = {The ViviTouch Studio is a prototyping tool that includes audio and video when protoyping vibrotactile feels $\backslash$cite\{Swindells2014\}. As visual cues are essential for establishing vibrotactile metaphors, the ViviTouch Studio puts VT effects in context. The iterative workflow involves three steps: acquire base media (previous file or a video clip), add or modify haptic effects, and playing the protoype. Key features include rapid import/export, video preview, effect/filter libraries, and easy A/B comparisons. These effects are non-interactive and non-dynamic; they are essentially another channel of output in a .mkv video file. Voltage vs. time waveforms are the paradigm for VT effects, as they support many different devices, and are stored as an XML format (for time, duration, channel, etc.).

In the case of beats it was possible to confirm the earlier observations of Helmholtz by improving the frequency resolution of the model ear.

In order to provide a more realistic and interactive experience, contact surfaces and haptic forces are modeled with radial basis functions, and videos are replayed in a haptic-driven style.},
