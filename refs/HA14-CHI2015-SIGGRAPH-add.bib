@article{Kim2009,
abstract = {Audiences are demanding increasingly immersive multimedia experiences in formats such as computer games and movies. Reflecting this drive, this paper presents an enhanced movie system which provides viewers with passive, on-skin, tactile sensations synchronized with audio-visual media. It first introduces the potential mappings through which tactile contents could be meaningfully added to such media, then describes a tactile movie system (including initial hardware design for a glove based vibrotactile device) and discusses a tool for creating and editing tactile movie contents which are tightly synchronized with audio-visual contents. The paper closes with the description of three short evaluations of the proposed tactile movie system. These characterize latency, an important aspect of the system performance, and explore user reactions to the novel content using both objective and subjective methods.},
