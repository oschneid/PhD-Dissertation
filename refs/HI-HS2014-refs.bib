abstract = {Though the relationship of touch and sound is central to music performance, and audio-tactile metaphors are pertinent to musical discourse, few empirical studies have investigated systematically how musical parameters such as pitch height, loudness, timbre and their interactions affect auditory-tactile metaphorical mappings. In this study, 40 participants (20 musically trained) rated the appropriateness of six dichotomous tactile metaphors (sharp-blunt, smooth-rough, soft-hard, light-heavy, warm-cold and wet-dry) to 20 sounds varying in pitch height, loudness, instrumental timbre (violin vs. flute) and vibrato. Results (repeated measures MANOVA) suggest that tactile metaphors are strongly associated with all musical variables examined. For instance, higher pitches were rated as significantly sharper, rougher, harder, colder, drier and lighter than lower pitches. We consider several complementary accounts of the findings: psychophysical analogies between tactile and auditory sensory processing; experiential analogies, based on correlations between tactile and auditory qualities of sound sources in daily experience; and analogies based on abstract semantic dimensions, particularly potency and activity.},

abstract = {Despite the plethora of vibrotactile applications that have impacted our everyday life, how to design vibrotactile patterns efficiently continues to be a challenge. Previously, we proposed a vibrotactile score as an intuitive and effective approach for vibrotactile pattern design. The vibrotactile score is adapted from common musical scores and preserves the metaphor of musical scores for easy learning. In this paper, we investigate the usability of the vibrotactile score, focusing on its learnability, efficiency, and user preference. Experiment I was to compare the vibrotactile score and the current dominant practice of vibrotactile pattern design using programming or scripting. The results gained from programming experts validated the substantially superior performance of the vibrotactile score. Experiment II compared the vibrotactile score with waveform-based design implemented in a few recent graphical authoring tools. Regular users without programming backgrounds participated in this experiment, and the results substantiated the improved performance of the vibrotactile score.},

abstract = {This paper reviews studies on the tactile dimensionality of physical properties of materials in order to determine a common structure for these dimensions. Based on the commonality found in a number of studies and known mechanisms for the perception of physical properties of textures, we conclude that tactile textures are composed of three prominent psychophysical dimensions that are perceived as roughness/smoothness, hardness/softness, and coldness/warmness. The roughness dimension may be divided into two dimensions: macro and fine roughness. Furthermore, it is reasonable to consider that a friction dimension that is related to the perception of moistness/dryness and stickiness/slipperiness exists. Thus, the five potential dimensions of tactile perception are macro and fine roughness, warmness/coldness, hardness/softness, and friction (moistness/dryness, stickiness/slipperiness). We also summarize methods such as psychological experiments and mathematical approaches for structuring tactile dimensions and their limitations.},

The vibrotactile score is a metaphor of the musical score to vibrotaction, and its design is adapted from two common musical scores (the piano score and the guitar tablature). Moreover, we developed an authoring tool, vibrotactile score editor (VibScoreEditor), that fully supports the vibrotactile score with intuitive graphical user interface. Another metaphorical feature, vibrotactile clef (analogous to the musical clef), is incorporated in the editor to make the process of composing vibrotactile patterns decoupled from the process of considering the signal-level characteristics of vibration. A few examples of vibrotactile patterns designed using the VibScoreEditor are also presented.},

abstract = {We describe key affordances required by tools for developing haptic behaviors. Haptic icon design involves the envisioning, expression and iterative modification of haptic behavior representations. These behaviors are then rendered on a haptic device. For example, a sinusoidal force vs. position representation rendered on a haptic knob would produce the feeling of detents. Our contribution is twofold. We introduce a custom haptic icon prototyper that includes novel interaction features, and we then use the lessons learnt from its development plus our experiences with a variety of haptic devices to present and argue high-level design choices for such prototyping tools in general.},

Even outside the classroom, Papert had a vision that the computer could be used just as casually and as personally for a diversity of purposes throughout a persons entire life. Seymour Papert makes the point that in classrooms saturated with technology there is actually more socialization and that the technology often contributes to greater interaction among students and among students and instructors.},

abstract = {Studied the difference between illusory and nonillusory figures with 30 untrained observers. Ss were asked to describe in detail each of 3 geometric figures drawn on cards so that the experimenter, not looking at the figure, "would know exactly how it looked." Two figures were illusions, but the 3rd (of an equally complex figure) was not. Half of the Ss were presented the control figure first, the other half saw it last. Qualitative differences were found between the Ss' reaction to the illusory and nonillusory stimuli. Although only 3 of 30 Ss maneuvered the control figure as they described it, 14 and 17 Ss in the other groups maneuvered the 2 illusory figures. Significant verbal differences were also found. It is concluded that illusions represent "ambivalent" forms of organization that create unresolved perceptual tension and do not allow for "progressive determination" of their essential character.

@article{Guest2011,
abstract = {No comprehensive language exists that describes the experience of touch. Three experiments were conducted to take steps toward establishing a touch lexicon. In Experiment I, 49 participants rated how well 262 adjectives described sensory, emotional and evaluative aspects of touch. In Experiment II, participants rated pairwise dissimilarities of the most descriptive words of the set. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) solutions representing semantic-perceptual spaces underlying the words resulted in a touch perception task (TPT) consisting of 26 'sensory' attributes (e.g., bumpiness) and 14 'emotional' attributes (e.g., pleasurable). In Experiment III, 40 participants used the TPT to rate unseen textured materials that were moved actively or received passively against the index fingerpad, volar forearm, and two underarm sites. MDS confirmed similar semantic-perceptual structures in Experiments II and III. Factor analysis of Experiment III data decomposed the sensory attribute ratings into factors labeled Roughness, Slip, Pile and Firmness, and the emotional attribute ratings into Comfort and Arousal factors. Factor scores varied among materials and sites. Greater intensity of sensory and emotional responses were reported when participants passively, as opposed to actively, received stimuli. The sensitivity of the TPT in identifying body site and mode of touch-related perceptual differences affirms the validity and utility of this novel linguistic/perceptual tool.},

abstract = {This paper reports two experiments relating to the design of Tactons (or tactile icons). The first experiment investigated perception of vibro-tactile "roughness" (created using amplitude modulated sinusoids), and the results indicated that roughness could be used as a parameter for constructing Tactons. The second experiment is the first full evaluation of Tactons, and uses three values of roughness identified in the first experiment, along with three rhythms to create a set of Tactons. The results of this experiment showed that Tactons could be a successful means of communicating information in user interfaces, with an overall recognition rate of 71\%, and recognition rates of 93\% for rhythm and 80\% for roughness.},
