\label{ch:hapticianinterviews}


High-fidelity haptic technology is expanding % emerging as a critical part of 
user experience in wearables, automobiles, and new media.
% Expressive actuators are increasingly deployed in consumer products like Apple's laptops (apple.com), wearable devices invite eyes- and hands-free interaction, and fabrication techniques further blur the distinction between digital and physical.
Haptic experiences have shown promise in multiple interaction aspects, %of domains, 
including emotional therapy \cite{Yohanan2011,Vaucelle2009}, education \cite{Sato2008}, and entertainment~\cite{SchneiderAsiaHaptics2014}. % interactions [].
% Exciting new technologies, such as variable friction displays [] and ungrounded force illusions [] have the potential to produce compelling sensations in consumer products.
Technological advances are making sensations more compelling at the level of consumer products, making it possible to render variable friction on direct-touch surfaces \cite{Levesque2011,Winfield2007}, and forces without grounding to a table or wall \cite{Culbertson2016,Winfree2009}.
% Wearables especially have pursued this, with devices like the Apple Watch [] and Pebble (?) making haptic actuators a priority.
Even commodity vibrotactile displays are increasing in expressivity, with high quality actuation and painstaking design a priority in devices like the Apple Watch (\url{www.apple.com}) and Pebble (\url{www.pebble.com}).

\inlineHeading{Obstacles to Design} 
%
However, % despite the increasing presence of haptic technology, 
content remains scarce and design knowledge is limited.
The academic literature suggests many challenges to design, including latency \cite{Kaaresoja2014}, individual differences in both programmed \cite{Levesque2011} and natural \cite{Hollins2000} textures, low-level perceptual variation \cite{Lo1984}, the effect of aging \cite{Stevens1992,Stevens1996}, and interpretation of effects \cite{Seifi2013,Seifi2015}, often due to personal experience \cite{Schneider2014}.
These are further reinforced by personal requests to the authors from industry practitioners.
We expect there to be many challenges facing industry designers, but have little direct evidence to reinforce this and guide research. %still rely on indirect knowledge.
% Many haptic applications are built upon realistic physical models, but must still be fine-tuned.  % and improved.
% \kmC{?? slc: Non-photorealistic } %% cross-modal analagy doesn't quite work as written. Abstract? Non-realistic? Techniques to create abstract signals (as opposed to high-fidelity recreations of a sensation found in the real world)
% techniques to create, \eg, vibrotactile feedback are even less understood.
% Though HCI researchers have long pursued haptic feedback and shown improved performance in various domains [], strict application of HCI design methods fail when applied naively to haptic-driven designs, and the specific challenges of designing haptic technology are many yet poorly documented.
% From an impoverished language [] to collaborative barriers []
Part of this comes from the rareness of professionals designing haptics explicitly, and absence of studies of their workflow.
In this work, we take a first in-depth look at haptic designers' experiences to confirm, correct, and elaborate expected challenges, and connect \haxd to other fields of design.
%Without \kmE{in-depth.} 
% \kmC{Logic problem - keep saying there are a lot of challenges, but also that we don't understand what they are. Need to present the evidence that the challenges are there, to motivate looking. I think the best evidence may be that (a) designers are asking for help (personal communication) and (b) designs aren't very good, and surely could be improved. Finally (c) we know stuff about people (how they perceive things, and individual differences) which \textit{must} make designing hard because it's so indirect. 
% understanding the challenges, we can hardly expect to make fast progress on delivering the promises made by tangible technology.
% }

\inlineHeading{Haptic Experience Design}
%
We define \haxd\ as: % ``haptic experience design'' (\haxd) as:
\begin{quote}
\it The design (planning, development, and evaluation) of user experiences intentionally involving both interactive technology and one or more perceived senses of touch, possibly as part of a multimodal or multisensory experience.
\end{quote}
%OS 04.21 We need a definition of haptic experience design, either from lit or create our own.
%KM 04.25 clarify relation to multimodal design (this is one of the challenges)
We use \haxd instead of the more general ``haptic design", which can also refer to design practices related to haptics but not directly involving the user experience, \eg, mechanical design of a new actuator or software design of a new control method.
Our definition also includes pseudo-haptics \cite{Pusch2011} and other illusions that trick the user into thinking haptic feedback is occurring without direct tactile or kinesthetic stimulation.
Much of what we find could also be gainfully applied to the design of tangibles, even with their lack of actuation, although we leave them out of our scope to focus on actuated interfaces.
For brevity, we use ``haptic designers" to refer to haptic \emph{experience} designers.
% \kmC{slc} % or, you could say ``HAX designers'' but perhaps a little too precious.


\inlineHeading{Target Audience}
We expect haptic experience designers will find our results familiar, and hope the articulated challenges and recommendations are useful for their practice.
However, we primarily target people who are one step removed from \haxd, \eg, with other design, haptics, or business expertise. %, such as non-haptic design experts, non-design haptic experts, and industry partners like entrepreneurs looking to work with haptics, or managers interacting with a haptic design group.

We expect \textbf{non-haptic \textit{design} experts} will find the specific challenges to \haxd informative by revealing processes of design that are invisible or taken-for-granted in other fields.
%their understanding of design broadened, especially with challenges that may not appear in more establish fields.
We also hope designers might lend their expertise to accelerate creativity tools for these complex physical interactive systems.

We expect \textbf{non-design \textit{haptic} experts} might further develop an appreciation for how design work fits into haptic technology, and understand how their devices and research findings are applied in practice.
Our recommendations also motivate several avenues for both basic and applied haptic research.

Finally, we expect \textbf{industry partners}  will gain insight in how the business world interfaces with haptic technology.
This includes those already involved with haptics or similar technologies like wearables, and those looking to become involved.
We hope our findings will cultivate connections between the diverse stakeholders interacting with \haxd, and that our challenges (and thus opportunities) might inspire people to work more with this emerging modality.
%We think this will be valuable both for those involved with haptics or similar physical interactive technology like wearables, and for those looking to become involved.


\inlineHeading{RoadMap}
In this work, we aim to shine a light into the dark land of % shed light on 
\haxd.
%: we document the challenges that are unique to or accentuated in haptic design, and apply  design thinking to those challenges.
In \textbf{\autoref{sec:interviews}}, we report a grounded theory \cite{Corbin2008} analysis of interviews with six professional haptic designers at four levels: 
the goals of and processes used by haptic designers; 
the complex, vertical natures of the experiences they design; 
the collaborative ecosystem in which our designers work play multiple roles; 
and the influence of the cultural context of haptics, its value, and risk.
%
In \textbf{\autoref{sec:workshop}}, we follow up on the themes on tools and collaboration discovered in these interviews with  a broader sector of industry and academic designers, accessed through a quantitative survey and qualitative suggestions from a workshop at a major haptics conference (World Haptics 2015).

Finally, in \textbf{\autoref{sec:discussion}}, we synthesize and discuss our findings in three major groups:

\section{Related Work} \noindent
In this section, we cover design thinking and theory, then review haptic technology and perception, and conclude with previous efforts to understand or support \haxd. 
% \kmC{slc} 
%% KM 06.06.14 Start this section with some rationale for the two major subsections, and for ordering them this way (existing tools, and insights from other design fields). At first I was thinking it should be reversed, but could see either way.
%% Also you've begun with some definitions on what haptics are. Probably should give this a section heading, and think more carefully about how far you want to go with it and what is the point of having it there. One possible point, for example, is the high diversity of both the haptic sense (multihaptics) and the high diversity of devices targeting those different sensory receptors. this underlies one of the big challenges. 


\subsection{Design Thinking}%: An Embodied Perspective}
\noindent Design thinking has become an empowering way to approach technology and user experiences, focused on rapidly generating, evaluating, and iterating on multiple ideas.
In this work, we adopt an embodied perspective, viewing cognition, and thus design, as an activity that occurs both in physical and social worlds \cite{Dourish2004,Hutchins1995}.
This perspective is particularly appropriate for \haxd as it matches recent thinking for interaction design \cite{Klemmer2006} and suits the physical, embodied nature of haptic technology.
We organize this section into three major areas involving different aspects of the designer's context: pre-design problem preparation, hands-on activities like sketching, and effect of collaboration.

\inlineHeading{Problem Preparation}
Also known as the ``problem setting" \cite{Schon1982}, ``analysis of problem" \cite{Warr2005}, or ``collect" \cite{Shneiderman2000} step, problem preparation involves getting a handle on the problem and drawing inspiration from previous work. %, and and establishing a first general approach with which to attempt a solution.
Creative acts are more accurately seen as recombination of existing ideas, with a twist of novelty or spark of innovation by the individual creator \cite{Warr2005}.
To create something new, a creative act requires an understanding of the domain (symbolic language of the field) \cite{Csikszentmihalyi1996}.
Sch\"{o}n demonstrated that designers initially frame their problems before developing a solution in order to match it to their repertoire, their collected professional (and personal) experience \cite{Schon1982}.
External examples are especially useful for inspiration and aiding initial design \cite{Herring2009,Buxton2007}; early and repeated exposure can increase creativity, but late exposure carries a risk of conformity \cite{Kulkarni2014}.
We show evidence that haptic designers follow these processes, with a dedicated problem preparation step and various collections of examples. 

\inlineHeading{Hands-On Design}
Experience design is often described as a funnel of idea candidates, where the designer iteratively generates and refines multiple ideas in parallel until a final, developed design (or set of designs) remains \cite{Buxton2007}.
% The designer must iteratively generate a varied set of initial ideas  (ideation) and then prune them (evaluation), repeating this step many times to settle on a single design \cite{Buxton2007}.
%Working with multiple ideas simultaneously is a boon to good design.
Developing ideas in parallel can facilitate generation and evaluation, delaying commitment to a single design \cite{Hartmann2008,Resnick2008}, while
in groups, sharing multiple designs improves variety and quality \cite{Dow2011}.


Sketching supports ideation, evaluation, and multiple ideas,
allowing the designer to
explicitly make moves in a game-like conversation with the problem \cite{Schon1982}.
Some researchers even declare sketching to be the fundamental language of design, like mathematics is the language for scientific thinking \cite{Cross2006}.
Sketching is rapid and exploits ambiguity, allowing partial views of a proposed design or problem.
Detail can be subordinated, allowing a designer to zoom-in, solve a problem, and then
abstract it away when returning to a high-level view.
%\osC{cut this paragraph - should some of it be incorporated?}
To explore design spaces creatively, designers must be able to rapidly undo, copy and paste, and see a history of progress; they need``high ceiling" and ``wide walls" \cite{Resnick2008}.
We are not the first to suggest sketching for haptic technology \cite{Moussette2010,Moussette2011}, though we find that this fluidity is hampered by painful iteration cycles.


\inlineHeading{Collaboration}
Design is a collaborative process; involving more people increases the potential for generating more varied ideas \cite{Warr2005}, and is important for creativity support tools \cite{Resnick2008,Shneiderman2000}.
Although sometimes group dynamics influence the design process negatively, proper group management and sharing of multiple ideas results in more creativity and better designs \cite{Herring2009}, and can even influence the work of crowds \cite{Dow2012a}.
Collaboration takes many forms, including informal \emph{relating} with colleagues, and \emph{donating} information to the public/annals of time \cite{Shneiderman2000}.
Csikszentmihalyi makes the provocative statement that creative acts, to be creative, must be accepted as useful by members of a field \cite{Csikszentmihalyi1996}.
Collaboration can also be organized into two dimensions: collocated (same location) or distributed (different locations), and synchronous (simultaneous)  or asynchronous (at different times) \cite{Ellis1991}.
As far as we are aware, we present the first description of the \haxd's collaborative ecosystem in \autoref{sec:interviews:collaboration}; many of these contexts require extra consideration for haptic technology.


\subsection{Haptic Perception and Technology} \noindent
Haptic technology is typically separated into two classes based on the main sense modality: \emph{tactile} sensations, perceived through the skin, and \emph{proprioception}, or the sense of body location and force.
Here, we focus on technologies most relevant to those discussed by our participants.
More detailed introductions can be found in elsewhere \cite{Hayward2007,ChoiKuchenbecker2013}.
%My three in-depth case studies will focus on vibrotactile sensations for two reasons: 1) they represent a diverse class of soon-to-be consumer-facing devices, and 2) they can be passively experienced, simplifying the interaction model (we do not need to design for input).

\inlineHeading{Tactile Perception and Technology}
Tactile sensations rely on multiple sensory organs in the skin, each of which detect different properties, \eg, Merkel disks detect pressure or fine details, Meissner corpuscles detect fast, light sensations (flutter), Ruffini endings detect stretch, and Pacinian corpuscles detect vibration \cite{ChoiKuchenbecker2013}.
%Temperature and pain are also detected through \osC{todo}.
Of these, the Pacinian corpuscle is most targeted by technology through vibrotactile (VT) sensations, where vibrations stimulate the skin.
The most common example of this is smartphone vibrations.
VT actuators can take may forms. Eccentric mass motors (sometimes ``rumble motors" or, when small, ``pager motors") are found in many mobile devices and game controllers, and are affordable but inexpressive.
%An unbalanced mass is mounted on the motor, which provides dramatic shaking of the device.
More expressive are tactors, or voice coils, implemented in a variety of ways and offering two degrees of freedom: frequency and amplitude.
Piezo actuation is a very responsive technique that is typically more expensive.
% One of the more common and expressive is the C2 tactor, intended to directly stimulate the skin through contact or a thin membrane; the tactile animation project [] uses an array of C2 tactors.
While tactors directly stimulate the skin, linear resonant actuators (LRAs) shake a mass back and forth to vibrate a handset in an expressive way; a common research example is the Haptuator \cite{Yao2010}.
Instead of directly stimulating the skin, this actuator typically shakes another device held by the user, such as a mobile device \cite{Yoo2014} or pen \cite{Culbertson2014}.
As of writing (2016), this type of actuator is increasingly deployed in mobile contexts (\eg, the Apple Watch Taptic engine).


\inlineHeading{Proprioception and Force Feedback}
Proprioception, the sense of force and position, is synthesized from multiple sensors as well: the muscle spindle (embedded in muscles), golgi-tendon organ (GTO) in tendons, and tactile and visual cues \cite{Kandel2000}.
Common devices include Geomagic Touch (previously the Sensable PHANTOM) and Falcon devices, offering three degrees-of-freedom: force in three directions and torque in three orientations.
At other times, entire screens might push back on the user in a single degree-of-freedom.

% \inlineHeading{Applications?}
% Simpler one degree-of-freedom devices are used in education, prototyping, and experimentation.
%  Devices include the Twiddler (a haptic knob from UBC) and the HapKit (a low-cost paddle by the Stanford CHARM lab).
%  %the latter is used in the CyberHap side project.


%\subsection{Applications}
%An early cinematic use of haptic feedback was in a multisensory experience called \emph{Percepto} used for the movie ``The Tingler" in 1959 \cite{IJsselsteijn2003}. %
%%G. Riva, F. Davide, and W.A. IJsselsteijn, “Presence in the Past: What Can We Learn from Media History?,” Being There: Concept, Effects and Measurements of User Presence in Synthetic Environments, IOS Press, 2003, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, pp. 17-40.
%Theater seats were equipped with vibrating devices that buzzed the audience during events in the movie.
%Current 4D theaters, rides, shows, and gaming arcades are equipped with sophisticated motion platforms (e.g. D-Box, http://www.d-box.com) that supplement visual scenes with subtle and synchronized movements.
%Large tactile transducers (such as Buttkickers, www.thebuttkicker.com) are also common with gaming and music content that shake the entire seat using the sound stream, therefore allowing users to feel `bumps' during musical beats and gameplay.   
%Custom editors (such as D-Box Motion Code Editor) and software plugins are provided to media designers that overlaid the visual and audio content with haptics, and allow designers to generate, tune and save frame-by-frame haptic content in an allocated track for it to play simultaneously with the media content. 

%In contrast to displacing the entire user body, recent multichannel haptic devices create percepts of dynamic and localized haptic sensations directly on the user's skin \cite{Israr2011} and in the mid-air \cite{Wilson2014}.
%%  Designers (and researchers) for these technologies must have 
%Use of these technologies requires
%extensive programming experience, knowledge of hardware and background in haptic sciences to generate expressive and meaningful haptic content. 
%% Due to the lack of
%Without guiding principles or haptic libraries,  content generation schemes are complex, device-specific and time consuming. 
%Recently, Schneider and colleagues introduced  the tool ``FeelCraft" for end users to create expressive haptic content using a library of \emph{feel effects} \cite{SchneiderAsiaHaptics2014}.
%By tuning parameters of these effects, users could personalize  haptic content, embed it in games and share effects with other users.
%Similar devices and authoring schemes are also developed for online social interactions using custom multi-actuator haptic devices \cite{Kim2009,Tsetserukou2009,Paneels2013}.%Tsetserukou, D. and Neviarouskaya, A. iFeel_IM!: augmenting emotions during online communication. Comp. Graphics & Applications 30 (2009), IEEE, 72-80.

\subsection{Previous efforts for \haxd} \noindent
Several software, hardware, and conceptual tools have been developed to help haptic designers.

\inlineHeading{Software}
Software support for haptic technology tends to manifest in three ways: large collections of haptic sensations, programming toolkits, and authoring tools.
%Most of these support simple VT sensations, or 3-dimensional virtual environments for force-feedback devices.

Sensation collections typically support VT stimuli. 
The UPenn Texture Toolkit contains 100 texture models created from recorded data, rendered through VT actuators and impedance-type force feedback devices \cite{Culbertson2014}.
The Feel Effect library \cite{Israr2014}, implemented in FeelCraft \cite{SchneiderAsiaHaptics2014}, lets users control sensations using semantic parameters, ``heartbeat intensity" respectively.
%and Feel Effects  provide examples for vibrotactile actuators, like those found in game controllers and mobile devices.
Immersion's Haptic SDK (immersion.com) connect to mobile applications, augmenting Android's native vibration library.
%FeelCraft's plugin architecture connects feel effects to various media types \cite{SchneiderAsiaHaptics2014}.
VibViz \cite{Seifi2015} offers 120 vibrations organized around many different perceptual facets.

Force-feedback environments tend to be supported through programming toolkits.
CHAI3D (chai3d.org), H3D (h3dapi.org), and OpenHaptics (geomagic.com) are major efforts to simplify force-rendering.
Table-top haptic pucks can use the HapticTouch Toolkit \cite{Ledo2012}, which includes parametric adjustment (\eg, ``softness") and programming support.
% Immersion's TouchSense Engage is a software solution for VT feedback programmingdevelopers. 

The haptics community has long recognized a need for non-programming compositional tools
\cite{Gunther2002}; these tend to focus on VT stimuli or simple 1-degree-of-freedom force feedback.
Many editors \cite{Enriquez2003,Swindells2006,Ryu2008,Swindells2014,Meyer2016,Schneider2016macaron}
%The Hapticon editor \cite{}, Haptic Icon Prototyper \cite{}, posVibEditor \cite{}, Vivitouch Studio \cite{}, and Macaron \cite{}
use graphical mathematical representations to edit either waveforms or profiles of dynamic parameters (torque, frequency, friction) over time.
Of these, Vivitouch Studio \cite{Swindells2014} offers the most integration with other modalities in games, and Macaron \cite{Schneider2016macaron} offers most accessibility by being online.
The Vibrotactile Score \cite{Lee2009} uses a musical metaphor, and is preferable to programming, but requires musical experience \cite{Lee2012}. 
Mobile ``sketching" tools like the Demonstration-Based Editor \cite{Hong2013} and
mHIVE, a Haptic Instrument \cite{Schneider2014} are useful for exploration, but not refinement.
Since iOS 5 (2011), Apple has let end-users create on/off vibrations as custom vibration ringtones.
Immersion's Touch Effects Studio lets users enhance a video from a  library of tactile icons supplied on a mobile platform.
Actuator sequencing \cite{Paneels2013}, movie editing \cite{Kim2009}, and animation \cite{Schneider2015} metaphors enable multi-actuator, spatio-temporal VT editing.
%More recently, Vivitouch Studio \cite{Swindells2014} allows for haptic prototyping of different effects alongside video (screen captures from video games) and audio, including features like A/B testing for simultaneous comparison of haptic content and exporting of a haptic video channel.
Though many of these tools are founded in an understanding of haptic designers' needs \cite{Schneider2015,Swindells2014} or begin to capture a slice of the \haxd process \cite{Schnider2016macaron}, they do not fully capture the context and activities of haptic designers.


% The control of multi-actuator outputs has been explored by TactiPEd \cite{Paneels2013}, Cuartielles' proposed editor \cite{Cuartielles2012}, and the tactile movie editor \cite{Kim2009}; the latter combined spatial and temporal control using a tactile video metaphor for dense, regular arrays of tactile pixels (``taxels"), including a feature of sketching a path on video frames. 
% % However, these approaches embrace the separate control of different actuators, rather than a single perceived sensation produced by the multi-actuator device, which we address with tactile illusions in.

% %The hapticon editor \cite{Enriquez2003}, haptic icon prototyper \cite{Swindells2006}, posVibEditor \cite{Ryu2008}, and Immersion's Haptic Studio (www.immersion.com) use a graphical representation to edit either waveforms or profiles of dynamic parameters (such as, torque) over time.

% %Both emphasize exploration and broad manipulation rather than finely controlled end results.

\inlineHeading{Hardware}
Platforms like
Arduino (arduino.cc) provide an open source microcontroller % platform 
and development platform % environment
for physical prototyping.
Phidgets (phidgets.com) facilitate rapid hardware prototyping with over 20 programming languages 
\cite{Greenberg2001}.
More recently, Wooden Haptics gives open-source access to fast laser cutting techniques for force feedback development \cite{Forsslund2015}.%, and
% Projects like 
%faBrickation streamlines prototyping for 3D printing \cite{Mueller2014}. % and other manufacturing techniques.
These platforms, especially Arduino, have made significant improvements to enable rapid iteration and hardware sketching.

\inlineHeading{Conceptual tools}
Some higher-level perspectives offer outcome targets or design attitudes to guide haptic practitioners.
``DIY Haptics'' categorize  feedback styles and design principles \cite{Hayward2007,MacLean2008}.
``Ambience'' is proposed as one target for a haptic experience \cite{MacLean2009}.
Haptic illusions can serve as concise ways to explore the sense of touch, explain concepts to novices and inspire interfaces \cite{Hayward2008}.
``Simple Haptics'', epitomized by \emph{haptic sketching}, emphasizes rapid, hands-on exploration of a creative space \cite{Moussette2010,Moussette2011}. % with a design perspective \cite{Moussette2010,Moussette2011}.
Haptic Cinematography \cite{Danieau2014} uses a film-making lens, discussing physical effects using cinematographic concepts.
Haptics courses are taught with a variety of foci including perception, control, and design, providing students with an initial repertoire of skills \cite{Okamura2012, Jones2014}.

% Haptics has often made use of metaphors from other fields.
% Haptic icons  \cite{MacLean2003} and phonemes \cite{Enriquez2006} are small, compositional, iconic representations of haptic ideas.
% Touch TV \cite{Modhrain2001},  tactile movies \cite{Kim2009}, haptic broadcasting \cite{Cha2009}, and Feel Effects \cite{Israr2014} attempt to add haptics to existing media types, especially video.
% Musical analogies have frequently been used to inspire haptic design tools, especially VT sensations. %unique.
% The Vibrotactile Score, a graphical editing tool representing vibration patterns as musical notes, is a major example \cite{Lee2012, Lee2009}.
% %The vibrotactile score provides an abstraction beyond low-level parameters and can draw from a musician's familiarity with the notation.
% Other musical metaphors include the use of rhythm, often represented by musical notes and rests \cite{Ternes2008,Brown2005,Chan2008, Brown2006a}.
% Earcons and tactons are represented with musical notes \cite{Brewster1993,vanErp2003}, complete with
% tactile analogues of crescendos and sforzandos \cite{Brown2006}.
% The concept of a VT concert found relevant tactile analogues to musical pitch, rhythm, and timbre for artistic purposes \cite{Gunther2002}.
% Correspondingly, tactile dimensions have been also been used to describe musical ideas \cite{Eitan2010}.


%\subsection{Language of Tactile Stimuli}
The language of tactile perception, especially affective (emotional) terms, is another way of framing haptic design.
%The language of tactile stimuli has a long history in psychological studies \cite{Okamoto2013}.
Many psychophysical studies have been conducted to determine the main tactile dimensions with both synthetic haptics and real-world materials  \cite{Enriquez2003,Okamoto2013}.
Language is a promising way of capturing user experience \cite{Obrist2013}, and can reveal useful parameters, e.g., how pressure influences affect \cite{Zheng2012}.
Tools for customization by end-users, rather than expert designers, are another way to understand perceptual dimensions \cite{Seifi2014,Seifi2015}.
However, this work is far from complete; touch is difficult to describe, and some even question the existence of a tactile language \cite{Jansson-Boyd2011}.
%There is a clear need to empirically investigate the subjective experience of touch-based interfaces, for which phenomenology is ideal \cite{Creswell2013, Moustakas1994}.
%Start with hapticons, tactons, vibrotactile icons, Earcons, Auditory icons...
%Participants described two different sensations, one oscillating at 16 Hz and the other at 250 Hz.

In this section, we present the findings from a qualitative analysis of six interviews with professional haptic designers.
One researcher analyzed these results with grounded theory~\cite{Corbin2008}, with influence from phenomenology~\cite{Moustakas1994}.
We group our findings with four subsections, found by looking at different levels of context \cite{Corbin2008} to cluster themes:

%
One researcher interviewed 6 participants (5 men) in April-May 2012.
Each interview lasted between 30-60 minutes and consisted of initial ice-breaker and general open-ended questions, then increasingly detailed questions about participants' processes.
Interviews followed a semi-formal, structured qualitative inquiry process that allowed for followup. % on interesting points.
%% KM 06.14: The timeframe might need explaining; relevance is that times have changed a bit in the intervening 4 years. e.g., see below
P2-5 were fully recorded and transcribed, while P1,6 results were collected from interviewer notes alone. % due to technical difficulties with recordings.
As such, results from P2-5 will be reported as quotations, while P1,6 comments be reported as notes.
\autoref{tab:designers} describes our participants and their projects.

To contextualize this interview data in time, %it is worth noting 
we note that in 2012 the following situation was generally true of professional haptic design.
%\kmC{Here, is it worth noting the isolation, lack of specialized training, ... or should we just stick with what has changed, and indicate that everything else is about the same?}
%
Our impression based on recent interactions with designers in comparable roles in industry is that at the time of this writing (2016) the situation has changed primarily in three respects: (1) hardware has improved and become more diverse, and (2) haptic feedback is more prevalent and expected in the consumer culture. Finally, (3) in a limited number of subdisciplines, \eg, gaming environments, specialized tools have begun to appear to solve very specific designer problems where the cost/benefit equation merits their development. 
However, the design pressures shaping practices and tools themselves have changed little, as confirmed by \autoref{sec:workshop}.
The themes we present were emergent, discovered while using qualitative techniques of clustering and affinity diagrams \cite{Moustakas1994}, memoing, and iterative coding \cite{Corbin2008}.

         described the haptic and audio processes as being the same.

        \textbf{P2} (M, age/experience tbd, apprx. 5-6 yrs in haptics, PhD) described two projects: his experience adding mechanical feedback to touch screens at a major automotive company, and his PhD work on remote tactile feedback, where feedback was displayed on one hand while the other interacted with a touch screen. P2's main concern is ``rich feedback", communicating information like affordances to the user. This is both pragmatic, such as ``consequences" of the button, and affective, aiming to have sensations ``feel right." P2 focused on button presses on a touchscreen, rather than exploring ``roughness" of a touchscreen or other surface. 
        % P2 accomplishes rich feedback by recreating physical buttons on a touchscreen; he eventually hopes to create virtual buttons that go beyond the physical world. P2 provided feedback in two ways ? tactile feedback from screen displacement, and remote tactile feedback. Dwell times are used to mimic force sensing and feedback in the former, while timing is used for reinforcement to effect the latter. In both case, there is an indirectness to the sensation/input, and timing is used to circumvent this. Latency, and timing, are critical. 
        
\\        \midrule
        
        \textbf{P3} (M, 10 years leadership experience with actuation, sensing, and multimedia, M.Eng.) worked at a company that sells actuators used to add haptics to technology (like a tablet computer, game controller, or mobile phone).
        P3 had 20-30 projects going on at any time, each with their own level of size, goals, constraints, and other contexts. His main goal was to sell a developed actuator (with several variants).
        % Companies (customers) provide an existing device they wish to augment with haptics, prototypes, mockups, or CAD designs of new devices, or receive an evaluation kit and work with the P3's company to establish their hardware needs. The augmented prototype is shipped back to the customer, often in a different overseas country.
\\        \midrule
        
        \textbf{P4} (M, 11 years of design, development, and analysis/simulation experience, PhD) also puts actuators into new form factors (e.g., touch screens in cars).  When he worked, he had limited time and resources, so there is not much time to change things. %Getting the outer dimensions for a visual impression is important.

        \textbf{P5} (M, 12 years of haptics UX experience, M.Sc.) held a user experience leadership position at major haptics company that sells haptic control technology and content; he described mostly software solutions.
        %P5's company is concerned with \qqquote{rallying the ecosystem} to make haptics more widespread.
        His company worked with different domains, but most examples are from mobile phones (handhelds), with a brief mention of automotive haptic feedback.
        They worked with extremely high-end piezo vibration actuators, high bandwidth (frequency and mechanical), and delivered software solutions for Android to their customers: OEMs (original equipment manufacturers).
        He described handheld feedback as two different classes: confirmation haptics, like a vibration to indicate a widget has been used, and animations/gestural feedback, which is more complicated.
        % There are two classes of feedback he discusses: confirmation haptics, and animations/gestural feedback.
        % Confirmation haptics are the primary product that P5 describes, adding haptics to the Android UI stack for major mobile phone manufacturers.
        % These effects are haptic confirmations of button presses extended to other UI widgets like drop-down menus and swipes to \qqquote{giving the user information that something is going on that they don't already know}.
        % Dynamics haptics, e.g., animations and gesture-based haptics, are a more challenging class of effects to design, integrate, and describe, and are left for future products.
        
\\        \midrule
        
        % CONFIRMATION HAPTICS: The primary project P5 described was adding haptics to the Android UI stack. In this case, the customers are major mobile phone manufacturers. The main goal was to take confirmation haptics present in buttons and extend them to other UI widgets (drop down menus, swipes, etc.). The value in this is in "giving the user information that something is going on that they don't already know". This is obvious with buttons, but less obvious in other widgets (e.g., date picker). However, the date picker gave interest, excitement, and a "mechanical intuition" or confidence in the UI (this contrasts with information they don't know, IMO).
        % ANIMATIONS AND GESTURES (DYNAMIC HAPTICS): P5 also distinguishes confirmation haptics with another class of interactions: animations and gesture-based haptics, described together as "dynamic haptics" (cf. "confirmation haptics"). Integrating haptics to animation is a challenging software engineering problem; P5 describes one point where animations were removed from the "confirmation haptics" package right before release, due to this challenge, and then added to a different product with dynamic haptics. Gesture-based haptics are much more complex to design and to explain (to the OEMs).
        
        \textbf{P6} (F, 5-6 years in haptics, PhD) worked at a major car manufacturing company.
        She primarily designs ``feel" properties such as friction, inertia, and detents of physical controls inside automobiles.
        P6 also works on active haptic controls.
        Design aspects include measuring force vs displacement profiles and maintenance of a large scale haptic design specification repository that spans user and technical requirements.
        This haptic specification repository is used by many engineering and business stakeholders across many sites in different countries.

% \subsection{The Haptic Experience Design Process}
% \label{sec:interviews:process}


\inlineHeading{Design Process Overview}
% \label{sec:interviews:process} \noindent
% Here we describe the design process through different stages: the beginning, iteration, refinement, and evaluation.
Most of our emergent themes applied to various points throughout the design process.
However, we did find that participants followed a familiar process of understanding the design problem, iteratively developing ideas and evaluating them.
Here we briefly outline this process, with links for connecting themes.

% \subsubsection{Beginning}
\textit{Project preparation:}
Participants described the initial stages of a project as a time to establish and understand requirements, gather initial design concepts, and define or negotiate project parameters.
Designers often collected examples of haptics for inspiration (Section~\ref{sec:interviews:collaboration}/Co5), and gathered requirements, both direct requirements for haptic designs (Section~\ref{sec:interviews:culture}/CC1) and project parameters around the value, cost, and risk of haptic technology (Section~\ref{sec:interviews:culture}/CC4,CC5).

% \textit{Examples} take many forms, including a collected ?button board? for inspiration (P2), a guidebook of physical button force profiles (P2), a mockup device sent from the client (P3), reference buttons (P4), or a large library of vibrotactile effects (P5).
% Engineering parameters are sometimes hard constraints (orientation of the actuator), or sometimes a ``best guess" from the customer on what they want, which can then be iterated upon (P4).

% \textit{Project parameters} are non-design concerns negotiated with customers, especially early.
% This includes establishing value propositions, cost and cost structures, and initial pitches, demos, and networking. %Sales reps (P3, described below), \kmC{??: tech days} to interested parties, and timelines all facilitate this process.
% The entire team sometimes meets together early (P6) to make sure everyone is on the same page.
%\qquote{P3}{demo parts to them, present business cases to them, and show them what they can do in order to gain market share, or increase their retail price when they add our technology}.
% We discuss these contextual parameters more in Section~\ref{sec:interviews:culture}.


% \subsubsection{Iteration} ? All (?) designers followed an iterative process.
\textit{Iteratively developing concepts:}
P2-6 referred an iterative process of some sort; they found different ways to fit it into their collaborative ecosystem and constraints.
Often, initial requirements were not actually what clients wanted, and our designers would have to iterate (Section~\ref{sec:interviews:culture}/CC1).
% P4 describes a situation where the customer provided engineering requirements, but \kmC{?? 1st prototype?: it} didn't feel ``right''; P4 and the customer then iterated rapidly in-lab over a day to find what did feel right, changing several best-guess low-level requirements.
% \textit{??Conventional UCD:}
P5's teams explicitly follow a conventional user-centered design process, iterating on prototypes and understanding of customer needs.
% \textit{Iterate by subsystem:} 
P3 sometimes has to ship mockups and devices back and forth with their customers (Section~\ref{sec:interviews:collaboration}/Co5).
Each design problem faced by our participants had to be treated as a unique problem, with designers fine-tuning their design to fit the problem (Section~\ref{sec:interviews:experience}/Ex5).
%(Does P3 iterate? They seem to ship only once?but they follow up with support.)
% Modularity is pursued to facilitate both iteration and later fine-tuning, through swapping in and out themes (P5), %[insert other example?] 
% %?and, uh, when, if we had known directly from the beginning where we would have ended, we would have ended with a smaller actuator module for uh, the demonstrator unit
% and different theoretical parameters are persued during iteration:
% \qquote{P4}{For the full application, we would have had to run through a few demonstrator units beforehand anyway, so it would not have made any difference [if we knew where we would end up]}.
%
% % \subsubsection{Refinement and fine-tuning}
% \textit{\kmE{Bespoke experiences:}}
% As we will elaborate in Section \ref{sec:tailoringandcustomization},
% our participants commonly tailored and customized their  designs depending on the application.
% % All (?) participants indicated some kind of tailored product.
% \osC{slc -KM}
% % OS 2016.03.29 I wonder if there's some sort of analogy to clothing tailoring, e.g., "bespoke haptics", "tailored" haptics, "off-the-rack" haptics
% % The term 'bespoke haptics' has been used. I've seen it a couple of times, and like it... google gives this
% % https://www.deakin.edu.au/research/iisri/our-research/haptics-research
% % 2007: http://www.sciencebusiness.net/news/72255/Edinburgh-spins-out-joint-science-art-haptic-technology-company 
% % I think okay to give it without reference, but don't make a big deal of it. 
% \kmE{Application- and client-driven (?)} refinement and fine-tuning was baked directly into some participants' business models.
% P3's company sells a single actuator, with several variants, which are used based on the project needs;
% similarly, P4's actuators are customized depending on the context. P5's design team chooses a small set of effects from their libraries that represent the unique branding of an application.
% \kmC{[ground better:] Having haptic effects being effective} depends on the specific context of a project (both physical layout and social/use context).
%\textit{Evaluation:} our designers also 
Our designers used a variety of evaluation techniques to choose their final designs (Section~\ref{sec:interviews:culture}/CC2).

We now proceed with our main cross-cutting themes, organized into three levels of context: the haptic experience and its implementation (Section~\ref{sec:interviews:experience}), the designers' collaborative ecosystem (Section~\ref{sec:interviews:collaboration}), and implications from the wider cultural context of haptic technology and business requirements (Section~\ref{sec:interviews:culture}).
These are outlined in \autoref{fig:themeoutline}.

\subsection{Haptic Experiences: ``It doesn't end at the actuator"}
\label{sec:interviews:experience}
\noindent
%\kmC{I like both subtitles - slc} % 'doesn't end at actuator' and 'systems solution challenges' are both important concepts to capture at heading level. How about ``Haptic Experiences [or HaxD] require system-level solutions: ''It doesn't end at the actuator'' -- too long??
%Haptics are multimodal and context-sensitive.
As we've discussed, the haptic sense is really a \emph{collection} of senses, synthesizing different material properties together in a holistic way.
Visual and audio feedback, grip, materials, and other dynamics all play a part in the final percept.
%synthesized together at different perceptual levels [], with visual and audio feedback not only reinforcing haptic perception, but often dominating []. \kmC{the quote is actually referencing the holisticness of the device itself, and how the device's complexity can change the designed sensation.}

\begin{quote}
\qquote{P5}{The problem is it doesn't end at the actuator, there's a lot to do with the case of the device, the mass of the device, the mechanical coupling between the device and the hand...this all comes into play because it's %, %you know it's 
a tangible experience, and so if there's mechanical resonances that get stimulated by the actuator that make it sound noisy, then it becomes a cheap experience, even if it has a piezo actuator.}
%and so this is all very important design consideration}.
\end{quote}

\noindent The holistic, context-sensitive nature of haptic experiences has implications for \haxd. Designers both face multimodal constraints and hvae opportunities to circumvent those constraints.  %, this is a double-edged sword. 
%Here, we discuss the nature of haptic experiences as vertical, multimodal systems.
We begin by discussing implications for implementation, where haptic components are directly related to the ``guts" of the system (Ex1).
% When designers can control these additional materials, they can enhance the experience.
% At other times, contextual factors offer constraints, or worse, are completely unknown.
% This also
Then, the opportunities for improving design: reinforcement and substitution are powerful tools for haptic designers (Ex2), as long as they have synchronized with a reliable clock (Ex3).
However, multimodal contexts are sometimes uncontrollable or unknown, barring designers from using their tricks (Ex4).
We finish this section by discussing how haptic experiences are often bespoke, 
tailored to constraints of known contexts, or customizable to unknown contexts (Ex5).
%This ``systems" formation also slows iteration and makes latency and timing a major concern.
% Other parts of the system add complexity, might be out of the designers' direct control (e.g., the visual interface might be handled by another company), or might be completely unknowable (the grip of a phone or the surface it is on).
%Ultimately, the multimodal nature of haptics adds complexity and uncertainty.

\themeHeading{Ex1}{``Changes are to the guts"}{Haptic components are vertical}
%\inlineHeading{``Changes are to the guts" -- haptic components are vertical}
Haptic experiences are created the actuating component interacting with most other system components.
Changing a haptic component can thus affect the entire system's design, unlike 
%Changing a haptic component is thus a change to the \qquote{P3}{guts}, where the design of the entire system is affected.
%P3 contrasts this with 
other upgrades, like improving memory in a mobile phone: \qquote{P3}{you get the impression every other month they have a new phone...but the guts of it do not change much}.
New phones often just have a faster CPU or more memory swapped into the same system. % upgrades can be as simple as adding a new memory chip.
%Unlike other components, like mobile phones, improving memory is quantifiable and fits into a dedicated, comparable category; haptics requires a .
Designers need to take the system into consideration when adding haptics:

\begin{quote}
\qquote{P4}{First we had to get the outer dimensions roughly about right, to get the visual impression close to what it resembles later in the application}.
\end{quote}

\noindent This effect is bidirectional. 
% Both physical and non-physical elements influence each other.
Changing the size or material of the casing can have a profound effect on the sensation; correspondingly, any changes to the haptics will have an effect on the entire structure of the device.
% This is built into our designers' process:
Changes to software are also cross-cutting:
\qquote{P5}{we're digging into the source code of Android...we need to make sure that we have the right hooks in the right locations...that's a software architecture issue, right?}.


%, and changes in other components will affect the haptics, as described above.

% As we'll see, this has implications for both the iteration cycle (which is slower and more painful), risk for adding or changing haptics, and latency. \osC{TODO: discuss some quotations about changing software by P5, and some others for P2-4}


%SOFTWARE
%P5: P5: um, well it?s a little, I?m sure it?s different than usual switch design, because, or control design, because, we?re digging into the source code of Android, and trying to figure out what, how we could associate input events with feedback
%? and so it?s, I guess it?s similar to mechanical control design, except that it?s all virtual, right, so now we have this event loop and we need to make sure that we have the right hooks in the right locations, and the right um, the right way to override existing behaviours, which Android already has some of, and the right way to enable this such that it?s easy to swap in and out effects in a theme context
%? so to basically re-format the whole experience in one fell swoop, you know that?s a software architecture issue, right?
%P5: um, there was a few, um particularly around um, let?s see, around animated widgets, so I don?t know how familiar you are with Android but there?s some widgets that have animation controllers associated with them, and um
% ? and that?s fine and that works great if you?re using a finger to interact with these things, but there are some controls which also can receive events from other parts of the system, notifications, or from other widgets, and if those are animated then you get into this kind of feedback loop, which makes the device kinda go crazy
% ? and so we, we had to, you know, engineer our way around that but, it?s not a super hard, um, just, you know, engineering work

% Subsubsection: Advantages, multimodal tricks
%
\themeHeading{Ex2}{``Have that solid click"}{Reinforcement and substitution}
% \inlineHeading{``Have that solid click" -- Reinforcement and Substitution}
When the context is known, designers can use physical system properties to improve haptics:
%With complete control over the end product, materials and housing can be changed: 
\qterm{P6}{metal makes unwanted sound, so change it with a plastic}.
Knowing the context, like a car dashboard, lets the designer make haptics more convincing with \underline{reinforcement},\eg, adding visual or audio feedback:
%Sometimes this is as simple as adding a audio click:
\qquote{P5}{%adding in some level of audio too, that also makes a huge difference...
%, especially in the automotive space...
%I work with some automotive people and they just, they
need to have that
%, you know a,
solid [haptic] click at 150 [Hz] plus some audio at 300 or 400 Hz, which is going to give you that sense of quality, and, consistency across the whole dashboard}.


When a known context has constraints, designers also use \underline{substitution} to provide haptics.
P2 describes two such occasions, one for sensing input and one for displaying output.
%, both in an automotive application.
%One major limitations of haptic displays is that they don't always directly match the desired sensation context.
%In these situations,
%substitution is a critical tool for designers.
%In one case, %substitution makes up for sensor modality:
Because P2 could not sense input pressure, he instead used %Instead of sensing input pressure, temporal features like vibrations and
how long the user was pressing the screen (``dwell time"): % are used in place of spatial sensing like pressure and force feedback:
\qquote{P2}{we were substituting the forces that are needed on the actual buttons with dynamic dwell times}.
%Alternatively, multimodal synthesis can make up for weaknesses in the display.
In another case, P2 could not actuate a touch screen, so he used tactile feedback on the other hand.
%Substitution is also useful for displays, e.g., when a touch-screen is pressed with one hand (e.g., right), while tactile feedback is displayed on the other hand (e.g., left).
With careful timing, %Because human brains
the user perceives a single sensation, letting P2 actuate another location, \eg, the steering wheel:
\qquote{P2}{somehow you connect these two things, the action with the dominant hand and the reaction that is happening somewhere else}.






% \subsubsection{``A reliable clock": Latency and Timing}
\themeHeading{Ex3}{``A reliable clock"}{Latency and Timing}
% \inlineHeading{Very fast feedback and a reliable clock -- Latency and Timing}
To effectively use reinforcement, and to have effective haptic feedback, timing must be tightly controlled.
%Timing is critical to enable multimodal reinforcement and maintain the magic of haptics.
This is well established in the literature \cite{Kaaresoja2014}, and well known to our participants:
\qquote{P2}{I think, audio feedback and tactile feedback and visual feedback has to happen at a certain time to have a real effect}.
%Because haptics are part of
%One stand-out result of systems modifications is that they are complex and have an major effect on component communication, latency, and timing.
Haptic actuators themselves have become very fast and responsive.
Previously, it had been a goal for our designers:
\qquote{P5}{[what we] strived in the past significantly to do was to push the market towards high mechanical bandwidth actuators, so actuators that can respond in 15 milliseconds or less}.
Now, high-quality actuators are the main competitive advantage our designers offer:
\begin{quote}
\qquote{P3}{High-definition feels over a very broad frequency range, with enough strength and small enough, and especially very fast response time, that's our business}.
\end{quote}
% \qquote{P4}{you get almost perfect perpendicular motion of the surface directed to the touch screen}.
Designers now focus on \underline{introducing no new delays to the stack}.
%when connecting with vertical components.
P2 describes unintentionally adding latency to one project: \qqquote{we had this Python program and Arduino and all this communication going on}.
P2 \qqquote{threw out some of the serial communication which [had] made the whole thing a little slow}, and thus, the \qqquote{latency again felt right}.
Timing problems between components can happen at any time:
\qquote{P5}{we've gotten in situations before where we've been very near to completion in design projects, and for whatever reason we can't get a reliable clock,  from the CPU, then the whole thing falls apart}.
%{P5}{um, cuz nothing is consistent, you have hiccups in the effects and, there's just no easy way psychophysically to bridge, a variable timer sensation}
% \osC{Need to add in quote or mention of fast actuators - components aren't the problem}

% \textbf{Hardware is not the problem, complexity is.}
% Latency is critical, and while good, fast actuators exist, designers can't add new bottlenecks. 
% Although responsive hardware used to be a problem (\qquote{P5}{[we] strived in the past significantly to do was to push the market towards high mechanical bandwidth actuators, so actuators that can respond in 15 milliseconds or less}), this is no longer the case:
% Haptic companies have become very good at creating good hardware:
% \qquote{P3}{high-definition feels over a very broad frequency range, with enough strength and small enough, and especially very fast response time, that's our business}\

% \osC{todo: fit this quote in}
% \qquote{P2}{on touchscreens you always want to be really fast if you input text or something,? and on push buttons, normally you think of a large thing and you have to press it down and it take you several seconds to activate}

The context of a haptic experience can limit the designer.
%Multimodal feedback is not always controllable, and sometimes actively constrains the designer.
%However, sometimes constraints remove the ability to use other modalities.
Eyes-free interaction in cars means not only that visual reinforcement is unavailable, visible movement must be completely avoided.

is tasked with creating a \qqquote{feelable but not seeable} sensation to \qqquote{avoid having to use visual feedback}, as \qquote{P4}{driver distraction is always a big topic}. 
% P4 had to actively avoid using visual feedback and rely solely on the tactile feedback of a moving touch screen, and actually make the motion unnoticeable visually.
This means P4 does not have full control over his designed haptic sensation, but can use audio reinforcement or substitution to handle constraints.

Worse is when the experience's context is unknown.
Stakeholders often keep key contextual information secret from designers, such as the visual interface: 
\qquote{P4}{we can suggest components, and suggest characteristics of the HMI [human-machine interface] system, but the exact visual design of the HMI system is the OEM's [original equipment manufacturer's] knowledge}.
P3 has %an explicit workflow when clients cannot send a prototype device.
%They have
an \emph{evaluation kit} to send to potential customers when customers' intellectual property (IP) is a concern: %who can control it with audio signals:

\begin{quote}
\qquote{P3}{[An evaluation kit is] basically a little box that consists of our actuator and some electronics, and that box is connected and driven through the USB port of a computer, and you can then mechanically integrate the box in your own way, so we don't need to know what their design looks like}.

This is exacerbated because it is %This could be because it is

%%Quotes for varying grips, orientations, dynamics, configurations
% P5: uh, well they make a huge difference in terms of damping, primarily, right so if the phone is sitting on a hard, like a metal table or you know a hardwood table, that kind of thing, and it's a LRA type actuator, it's going to sound kind of cheap, because it's gonna really, there's no damping at all in that situation, it's just going to be this very harsh vibration, um, whereas if you have an eccentric mass motor and it's sitting on a rubber mouse pad, then it's going to sound like a, more like a  purring, uh sensation and you may even feel it a little bit on the table um, and so, the problem is is that there's, as a designer you have no control at all over those external scenarios, I mean both of them are equally likely, and so without some sort of knowledge of that, there's not really much you can do from a haptic perspective, other than allow the user to turn it up or down

Some slower, and some faster, and then I would ask the people which button is harder to press, and I would not tell them about the different types of speed or different speeds of the feedback I would just (incomprehensible) ask them which button is harder to press and then, maybe, we'd find out if this correlation is really correct?

P4
% o	?we cannot really keep our technology itself confidential, that's uh, that's at least as soon as a product is on the market, our competitors take the product and disassemble it, so they know about our technology, and therefore we of course try to present our technology before we get it into the market.?

\subsection{Collaboration: ``Rally the ecosystem"}
\label{sec:interviews:collaboration}
\noindent All six participants indicated collaboration was an important part of their work and design process.
Haptic designers are part of interdisciplinary, international teams, and do not make haptic experiences alone:

\begin{quote}
    \qquote{P5}{We basically have to rally the ecosystem...we have to go and find, y'know, somebody to supply the amplifier part, somebody to make the motor, somebody who knows enough about the Android kernel...we have to be, kind of, renaissance men if you like}.
\end{quote}

\noindent In this section, we describe the collaborative ecosystem.
First, we provide an overview of group structure and interdisciplinary roles found in our participants' groups (Co1), including a focus on the role of engineering (Co2).
We then discuss the dispersion of stakeholders internationally and in different organizations (Co3), including a focus on a connecting role, sales reps (Co4), and the use of demos and documentation (Co5).
We distinguish Collaboration themes (Section~\ref{sec:interviews:collaboration}) from Cultural Context themes (Section~\ref{sec:interviews:culture}) by focusing on specific communication methods and roles rather than underlying values and public consciousness.

%P1 mentions the influence of different roles/backgrounds, e.g., \qterm{P1}{technicians don't give pushback if they believe they have a problem}.
P5 describes his company's job as \qqquote{rallying the ecosystem}, finding diverse expertise and establishing a production chain.
P6 describes different roles in her team, who work more closely together at different stages: \qterm{P6}{user [research], design, ergonomics, haptics, electronics, all come together}.
This is reflected by the diverse internal roles (\underline{\autoref{tab:roles:internal}}), but also in the diverse work in single projects and individuals:
% A single project can involves tasks from hardware to software and high-level design:

\begin{quote}
\qquote{P3}{We do some mechanical integration work, we help [our international customers] with designing the electronics, we have reference designs there, we have a couple of reference effects, and then we ship the part back and they go on with further doing the software integration and designing the haptic effects}.% that they want to have}.

\noindent Our participants worked in groups of various sizes.
P2 worked with a student in a team of 2, while P5 describes different: design team, UX team, engineering, each with different responsibilities.
This collaboration can be collocated or remote: P6 describes the different divisions in her company as being physically close together, while P3 has sales reps overseas to help with external collaboration.

Especially in smaller groups, team members fill multiple roles.
Sometimes this falls naturally into their background:
%Even when a business model is software-focused, participants compare to physical domains:

Larger groups were able to have more specialized individuals.
Especially common was a dedicated engineering or technical support team, tasked with implementing prototypes for design and user research teams.


\begin{quote}
\qquote{P5}{In our design research team we don't do any internal prototyping, we rely on engineering resources to do all our prototyping}.

\noindent P5's group says that neither the design team nor the UX team build prototypes, though the UX team facillitates and evaluates them. 
P1's team is similar:
\qterm{P1}{give qualitative feedback and ranges to the technicians}.
Engineering departments are sometimes \qterm{P6}{physically very close to other depts}, presumably to interact with different divisions and groups.
However, separating expertise can cause gulfs of collaboration:

\qquote{P3}{[it's] risky to suggest changes to their component}. %, so need to get around it}.
% Combined with the segmentation between engineering staff and the design or business group can lead to barriers, especially with respect to risk.
P3 says that to pitch to other companies, you need to reach \qqquote{C-level people} like the CEO, or other business or manager types:

% \inlineHeading{External roles -- connecting organizations internationally}
Haptic designers also worked closely with external stakeholders like potential customers and manufacturers.
%Our participants offered various products and services, such as actuators, the customization and installation of actuators, software, and designed haptic content.
Our participants have suppliers, especially hardware suppliers, and often sold to manufacturers who then sell their own product to the end-user.
\underline{\autoref{tab:roles:external}} provides details on the external-facing roles.

% \inlineHeading{``Sales Reps" -- Facilitators and Advocates}
P3 describes sales reps in-depth as key team members.
Sales reps are trained locally at the headquarters in North America, then sent the customer's area, often countries like Korea, Japan, China, and Taiwan which have large consumer electronics and gaming markets.
They can speak the local language and understand the local culture, but also facilitate demos and persuade customers to pursue business with the designer's team. %, becoming an advocate for the product.
%They can make sure demos work, because they can be quite complicated.
% They are a key part of an international team, important for P3's US-based company reaching out to countries 
%, showing how to use the hardware (they've been trained), and creating or becoming advocates. 
If a demo is sent to a company without a sales rep, customers sometimes respond by shipping the device back and requesting assistance, but often don't respond at all:

\begin{quote}
\qquote{P3}{If we try to just ship them a part...in the best case they come back and say well it doesn't as we thought, can you help us?...in the worst case they don't even contact us back and we never learn why they didn't pursue an idea or an opportunity. It's still a complicated setup to make haptics work, there?s lots of aspects that you have to take into account, and if you don?t do it properly, you're going to be most likely very disappointed about what the outcome is}.
\end{quote}

%this can be very disappointing if you don't do haptics properly, it's very complicated to set up. 
%ship device mockups and evaluation kits back and forth;
%The relationship with other companies depends on whether they are big/small, what their project goals are; language, cultural, geographic differences, sales reps help with these and with demos, which *need to be done properly* or they're ineffective,
%In \autoref{tab:stakeholders}, we connect sales reps to another connecting role: tech scouts.
%and customers won't pursue an idea;
\noindent Big tech companies sometimes invert this from a push model (where the haptics company uses a sales rep) to a pull model with tech scouts (who reach out to haptics companies).
Sometimes, companies fill this role without dedicated sales reps: P4 goes to customers regularly in confidential meetings, receiving specifications and working collocated with the customer to get their product to feel \qqquote{just right}:


\begin{quote}
\qquote{P4}{There is always [the] option, as we did with one of our customers, that we simply went into the lab for a day or two, and just worked on simulated button feel, together with the customer, to get the feel just right}
\end{quote}

\noindent In all cases, content can fall through the cracks. 
P3's company provides technology, but \qquote{P3}{the issue that we are having with uh, the content providers that need to get interested and believe into it...creating the haptic effects is something that we haven't been involved in in a lot of detail in the past}.
P5's company does have a set of 150 effects, from which they select themes.
The other participants all mention technology they develop, with content directly related to their hardware solution.



\themeHeading{Co5}{``Your piezo demo, we love it"}{Demos and documentation}
% \inlineHeading{Demos and Documentation}
Demos are essential to showing both the value of a haptic experience and enabling two-way communication with the customer.
They can clarify requirements and grab attention from clients:
\qquote{P5}{we'll often get the OEMs who will say, well you showed us your piezo demo, and we love it, it feels great}.
Demos can be conducted in-person (synchronously) at events like tech-days or one-on-one meetings:
\qquote{P4}{the customer either comes directly to us, we go towards our customers regularly, have our tech days, similar to automotive clinics}, or asynchronously, remotely shipped.
Demos are complicated and need an experienced handler like a sales rep.
%if try to just ship them a part, and a lot of them they are asking for it, well just ship us your part, we take care of integrating it ourselves, in the best case they come back and say well it doesn't as we thought can you help us, and they probably ship us back what they put together and we try to fix it? in the worst case they don't even contact us back and we never learn why they didn't pursue an idea or an opportunity, cuz they, it's still a complicated setup to make haptics work
%\qquote{P3}{the sales rep knows how to operate it}.
Once setup, demos are often adjusted, but this is easier than setup: % possibly needing extra demo infrastructure or an experience demoer:
\qquote{P4}{From the moment the actuation module was working...it was just cranking up the maximum current or reducing the maximum current}.


Demos are often collected into groups.
P5 describes downloading apps that use his technology and \qqquote{sticking those in [their] demo suite}.
P1 and P2 talk about collecting examples for inspiration and guidance early in design:
it's \qqterm{quicker to go out and buy examples}, like \qterm{P1}{15 or 16 appliances that had notably different feelings}.
P2 instructed his student to \qqquote{collect physical push buttons just to get in contact with all the diversity of stuff}, and ended up with a \qqquote{button board} to guide design.
He also talks about company guidelines:

\begin{quote}
    \qquote{P2}{When I was at [a major automotive company] 3 years ago...they had this guideline book...they had guidelines on the design of physical widgets like sliders, physical sliders, push buttons, rotary things...they defined thresholds basically where these forces have certain thresholds and if you get over the threshold something is happening}.
\end{quote}

Demo setups can thus be stored long term for internal documentation (button board, guideline book), but they can also be ephemeral (tech days).
% Rapid collaborative editing can be useful to find what feels right, especially when designers have to deviate significantly from a direct translation of mechanical button in order to be compelling.
% This often stems from customers not knowing what is available to them.
%:\qquote{P4}{we had one sample, the customer a surface acceleration of 10 to 20 G perpendicular and a travelling distance of 2-3 tenth of a mm, we ended with an acceleration of 2G and a travelling distance of .4 of a mm,? so, due to the size of the module, simply the high accelerations were too high for a good variable feel of the module}.
%Demo kits can even be sent to potential customer so they can protect their intellectual property.
%\osC{todo: resolve this with next 1-2 sections}
In both cases, they can help to articulate the value, especially valuable when most people do not yet understand haptic technology.


%Button Board Quotes:
%P1: quicker to go out and buy examples.  collect a bunch (15 or 16 appliances that had notably different feelings). ******
%I had the special? student of mine, and I know that he?s really into sketching hardware and building stuff and? he is doing stuff with Arduino, so I asked him to collect physical push buttons just to get in contact with all the diversity of stuff P2
%we made this button board, we called the thing a button board and it was a, (incomprehensible) button board, and we tried to implement as much different push buttons as we could find in this um, in this board P2
%when I was at (company) 3 (incomprehensible) years ago they had this, yeah, it was like, a guideline book, they had this guideline book on physical push buttons, so they defined, redefined the forces that are needed to make a push button a (incomprehensible) push button
% so they had guidelines on the design of physical widgets like sliders, physical sliders, push buttons, rotary things, this was really interesting P2
% mm, yeah, these (company) design guidelines they?re really basic, and they had all these different kinds of buttons like push buttons with two states, or push buttons with only one state and you, can release it again, and they defined thresholds basically where the forces, these forces have certain thresholds and if you get over  the threshold something is happening so ? um, I think this is much more a design thing to, to coin a trademark or something (P2)

%P5 demo suite quotes:
%and so, I think the most memorable day was when we started downloading apps, and realized that, yes, in fact this does work, and not only does it work but it works pretty well for a variety of apps, and it was a couple of surprising apps that it worked really well for, and basically we ended up just sticking those in our demo suite even though we had no relationship whatsoever to the developer ? so, their app just worked, and it worked really well.

%P5: right.? and, we?ll often get the OEMs who will say, well you showed us your piezo demo, and we love it, it feels great, we?re building this phone that has a, y?know, 10 cent eccentric mass motor in it, can you make it feel the same? Right, and the answer of course is no.

%of haptics is not yet persuasive}
\noindent Haptic technology has yet to penetrate the public consciousness.
Participants reported major difficulty when working with both customers and users, including a lack of understanding what haptic technology is and how to work with it: %, partially because of the youth of the field.


% \begin{quote}
%     \qquote{P3}{It's a little bit like with uh, the gyroscope sensors, in the beginning they were kind of using this just to change the orientation from landscape to portrait on the mobile phone...and then somebody came up and used it for games and today it?s used for navigation and all kinds of things, uh, so? I think [haptic] technology today is really at an early stage, when you compare it to graphics, uh, it might be 30 years behind graphics, or maybe I'm too pessimistic there}.
% \end{quote}




\begin{quote}
    \qquote{P3}{People really don't know what to do with [haptics] and I think within the haptics community we need to...continue to push it into the market, but once it's there I think it's going to add to the user experience and will be a standard feature in the future}.
\end{quote}


\noindent Specifically mentioned were the difficulty in understanding customer requirements (CC1), and knowing how to appropriately evaluate haptic experiences (CC2).
As a technological field, secrecy and intellectual property are important concerns for both designers and customers (CC3).
Designers had ways to pitch the value proposition of haptics, often tied to UX and branding (CC4), but risk and cost of adopting the technology often make it a hard sell (CC5).


\themeHeading{CC1}{``Hard to express what they need"}{Understanding requirements}
% \inlineHeading{``Hard for them to really express what they need" -- Understanding requirements}
\label{sec:interviews:express}
%: Language, content, and requirements}
Customers found it difficult to both understand and request their needs.
Our experts focused on the end result because it gives them and their designers the ability to solve problems: \qterm{P6}{Don't specify elements. Only give end product.  Don't tell how to restrict; can give hints}.
However, requested end-results are often vague or confusing, like \qquote{P4}{good variable feel}:

\begin{quote}
    \qquote{P4}{The customer only came with a question, yeah, how does it feel variable? (laughing) Here it did not really describe how it should feel variable}.
    %, that was the most important question he had}.
\end{quote}


\noindent To make these impressions concrete, customers initially give engineering parameters as their best guess.
P4 in particular talks about his customers, who might point to a  \qqquote{reference button which is available directly on the market, from companies like (company 1) or (company 2), and they say it has to feel exactly like this button}, or
request \qquote{P4}{a surface acceleration of 10 to 20 G perpendicular and a travelling distance of .2-.3 mm}.
This might have little bearing to the final result, after the designers iterate with the customer: \qquote{P4}{we ended with an acceleration of 2G and a travelling distance of .4 of a mm,? so, due to the size of the module, simply the high accelerations were too high for a good variable feel}.
The goal function of good variable feel was achieved, but the initial engineering-level specification was completely off.

% two different ways: low-level engineering parameters like \qterm{P2}{force profiles} or \qterm{P4}{travel distance} and high-level affective terms like \qterm{P2}{feeling right or alive} or \qquote{P4}{good variable feel}. 
% Examples, such as physical reference buttons, are used for requirement expression from clients, communication between and within organizations, and ideation.



% P4: hm.? (incomprehensible) there is always option, as we did with one of our customers, that we simply went into the lab for a day or two, and just worked on simulated button feel, together with the customer, to get the feel just right? so, we modified the push(?) strength, the push profile, so the actuator profile, we modified the damping, the spring constant, the spring behaviour, of our actuator, similar as you would do it on a mechanical button, and really tested for hours(?) several different versions of it, using Mickey Mouse ears

% \begin{quote}
%     \qquote{P4}{Because tactile feedback technology is so new, also for them it is too new, so, it's hard for them to really express what they need}.
% \end{quote}

Other participants showed this duality between high-level affective goals and low-level guesses.
P1 especially used affective and psychological terms when considering design, such as semantic differential scales:
\qterm{P1}{good/bad; gender (robust/delicate; size); intensity (sharp/dull; bright/dim, fast/slow); novelty}.
Haptic designers often connected low-level/high-level terms through iteration, or with their own way of representing features like quality:
%\qquote{P5}{solid click at 150 plus some audio at 300 or 400 Hz, which is going to give you that sense of quality, and, consistency across the whole dashboard},
\qquote{P5}{[audio click gives] quality, and, consistency across the whole dashboard},
\qterm{P6}{mass is big for quality...for the haptics, nice feedback w/ good snap gives a sense of quality}.
% Our designers must pay attention to these details: \qquote{P6}{Take into account fashion and consumer electronics; what does one associate with quality.  Let this influence.}




% P4: it?s, because it?s uh, tactile feedback technology is so new, also for them it is too new, so, it?s hard for them to really express what they need



%P3: P3: well, um, that is the uh, the issue that we are having with uh, the content providers that need to get interested and believe into it, so we are providing the technology that allows and enables to create high-definition feels over a very broad frequency range, with enough strength and small enough, and especially very fast response time, so that?s our business? now creating the haptic effects is something that we, we haven?t been involved in in a lot of detail in the past and that?s why I, I actually contacted Karon to help us with that and uh do a study and start working also on the emotional side of haptics but, that?s something that, we haven?t done a lot 
%P3: people really don?t know what to do with it and I think within the haptics community we need to make sure that we don?t lose our breadth and have enough um, kind of resources to continue to at the moment rather push it into the market, but once it?s there I think it?s, it?s going to be, going to add to the user experience and will be a standard feature in the future, it?s like? like having a touchscreen now on smartphones which nobody expects any other way anymore uh, it?s just, I mean it happens to me that I sometimes pull out my old, uh, tom-tom navigation device in my car and I, I uh, and that one didn?t have a touch screen back then (laughing) so I tap on that one and so it?s the same thing with haptics, at some point it?s just going to expect that you get some nice haptic feedback and uh, but uh getting there is still a couple of years out, so, I think


%P3: P3: um, yeah, I would say it?s a little bit like with uh, the gyroscope sensors, in the beginning they were kind of using this just to change the orientation from landscape to portrait on the mobile phone and then they kind of put in that rather extensive sensor back then for uh, a limited functionality? and then somebody came up and used it for games and today it?s used for navigation and all kinds of things, uh, so? I think the technology today is, is really at an early stage, it?s probably when you compare it to graphics, uh, it might be 30 years behind graphics, or maybe I?m too pessimistic there but


%P4: P4: uh, that?s, different. Some customers say, there?s a reference button which is available directly on the market, from companies like ??? or ???, and they say it has to feel exactly like this button (laughing) I?ll just say, yes, we expect the surface movement or, there?s an acceleration of 10G, for example, and a, there?s a movement distance of 1/10th of a millimetre, and try to just describe the physical movement of the button, or of the touch pad.

%P6: Mass is big for quality; surface temp. (no metal); optics for surface.  For the haptics, nice feedback w/ good snap gives a sense of quality.  A good negative torque with encoder.
%P1: Caution against novelty because this will wear off; focus on everything else instead.  Chasing new designs.  Novelty was associated w/ an usual sound; uniqueness was good.
%P1: novelty is also an emotional dimension.  can get emotion bang for buck w/ novelty.
%NOTE: P1 used more psych terms than low-level engineering or physical params
%p1: - use psychology techniques:  semantic differential method (rating scale of two opposite words) -- sound or tactile control
%- a number of word pairs.  not too narrow on a particular experience
%P1: - pattern:  always same 3 clusters of words:  (SEMANTIC DIFFERENTIAL)
    %  good / bad; 
    %  gender; (robust/delicate; size; small) -- not +ve / -ve
    %  intensity; (sharp / dull; bright/dim; fast/slow);
    %  novelty (Jim's own experience; applied find); sony -- dominance?  (consumer products)
% %P1: 4 dimensions equal?  some are more prominent; some shifting occurs.  use factor analytics techniques; clustering of variance is explained & hierarchy; good / bad is usually 1st or 2nd most important.  most interesting are the others that get into subtlties.
% controls usually have a robust vs. pliable feel.  Intensity in detents; esp. knobs or buttons.
    % - think of 2 criteria (word pairs to describe these dimensions).
    % - depending on product, choose words for a product.  words are targeted w/ conveying info.
    % - e.g., feminine brand image.
    % - Art:  get a sense of the subtlties.



% - different urgency differed in terms.


\themeHeading{CC2}{``It feels right"}{Evaluation}
% \inlineHeading{Evaluation}
Our designers all evaluated their designs but demonstrated different methods of evaluation, consistent with our workshop survey (Section~\ref{sec:workshop}).
P2 explicitly evaluates both low-level, pragmatic concerns (\eg, task accuracy and speed) and high-level affective concerns like feeling ?personally involved? (with the AttrakDiff  questionnaire \cite{Hassenzahl2003} (\url{http://attrakdiff.de})).
P5's user experience team conducts validation (details aren't included).
Small-scale acceptance testing was employed by both P2 and P4: when iterating in-person with the customer, P4 kept iterating until the customer said it \qqquote{felt right}; P2 only had himself and his student evaluate their designs in an academic context, despite indicating a desire to do a more thorough evaluation.
P3's group doesn't create content, but indicated a desire to look into that and investigate it with studies.


There seems to be a clear desire for stronger evaluation, but as-is, it's mostly lightweight, ad-hoc acceptance testing. 
This is consistent with our workshop findings, which suggest little real-world or \emph{in situ} evaluation.
% (P1, P6??)
However, deployment seems to be a natural way to see if the design is good enough, as the ultimate acceptance test.
P5 described his most memorable moment of his software project being when his product had been deployed and used by a software development team.
Seeing a haptic-enabled app available for download, and feeling it in context, was impressive:

\begin{quote}
    \qquote{P5}{I think the most memorable day was when we started downloading apps, and realized that, yes, in fact this does work, and not only does it work but it works pretty well for a variety of apps...
    %, and it was a couple of surprising apps that it worked really well for, and basically
    we ended up just sticking those in our demo suite even though we had no relationship whatsoever to the developer. So, their app just worked, and it worked really well}
\end{quote}



\themeHeading{CC3}{``Kept confidential"}{Secrecy and intellectual property}
% \inlineHeading{Secrecy and Intellectual Property}
\label{sec:interviews:culture:secrecy}
%When establishing requirements, designers work closely with clients, with back and forth to understand their goals:
%\qquote{P4}{the customer only came with a question, yeah, how does it feel variable? (laughing) here it did not really describe how it should feel variable}.
Sometimes the customer does not know what they want, but in other cases, they have important information they need to withhold.
%Like many fields of technology, haptics is no stranger to confidentiality.
%in high-tech companies, like haptics.
As mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:interviews:experience}/Ex4, secrecy in haptics has major implications that inhibit design, especially given the verticality of haptic technology:

\begin{quote}
    \qquote{P3}{Somebody wants to design a completely new gaming controller for a gaming console, so they might just have some CAD drawings or they might have something they don't want to share with us, so in that case we provide them an evaluation kit...we don't need to know what their design looks like, they can really work on it internally}
\end{quote}

\noindent P3's clients are able to receive an \qqterm{evaluation kit} and create content with audio editors.
P4 describes meetings with customers that preserve confidentiality:
%and tech days, where just customer, themselves, and \qqquote{not many suppliers} are present, to preserve confidentiality.
\qquote{P4}{on these tech days it?s usually only one customer and not that many suppliers at the same time, sometimes only the customer and us, to make sure our development are kept confidential}.
Once technology of P4's company is on the market, it's no longer secret - rivals can copy or reverse engineer the devices, so there are lots of demonstrations before release of the tech.


Secrecy can cause delays for software too.
P5 delivers a modified Android kernal to his customers, software developers.
However, they aren't given an early release, and thus they \qquote{P5}{always lag the market by two months at least, to get an update [for Android]...it?s annoying because, y?know, as soon as the OEMs get the source code they want to put it in their product right away}.
%, and then we say, but just wait, it?ll take us a couple months to do it.}
%So secrets are kept both in the haptics company and in the client's - in the client's case, essential components like the final visual design are kept secret *****, critical in such a multi-factored, vertical industry.
% Because haptic technology is not directly supported in the software pipeline, customers (in this case, software developers) are forced to wait.

% P4: we cannot really keep our technology itself confidential, that?s uh, that?s at least as soon as a product is on the market, our competitors take the product and disassemble it, so they know about our technology, and therefore we of course try to present our technology before we get it into the market.
% P4: the design process  is not really that, that much of our own intellectual property only, so that?s always, in discussion with the customer and together with the customer and uh, the customer is dealing with our competitors as well, so they are using the same technologies and designing it, but uh, the, technology behind this interface (are fixed?), that was uh, what the end customer does not see, that?s certainly our own technology.? that?s, that?s kept confidential until the product is on the market. But I?m not sure that was your real question. (laughing)

\themeHeading{CC4}{``Articulating the value"}{UX and branding}
% \inlineHeading{``Articulating the value": UX and branding}
\label{sec:interviews:value}
Our participants were all passionate about haptic technology and its benefits.
The value of haptics can be connected to better performance on various tasks: P2 tried to \qqquote{support people interacting bimanually to find out if they are more accurate in drag and drop tasks, [or] faster}, but also whether they would \qquote{P2}{feel more personally involved in the interaction somehow}.
This latter goal, of user experience or rich feedback, was the primary value for haptics:

\begin{quote}
    \qquote{P3}{It's? like having a touchscreen now on smartphones which nobody expects any other way anymore...sometimes pull out my old, uh, tom-tom navigation device in my car, and that one didn't have a touch screen back then (laughing) so I tap on that one [expecting it to respond to touch input], and so it's the same thing with haptics, at some point it?s just going to expect that you get some nice haptic feedback, but getting there is still a couple of years out}
\end{quote}

\noindent As mentioned in \autoref{sec:tailoringandcustomization}, tailoring and customization are important for each implementation.
This is also true for value:
differentiable sensations are important to help distinguish overall user experience and provide branding.
\qterm{P1}{look for alarms that were different; branding.  effective, but different.}.
Companies and products need to have both a cohesive and differentiable feel.
P2's company \qqquote{guideline book}, which defined force profiles for buttons, was helpful to \qquote{P2}{coin a trademark}.
%P2 and his student follow this book but contrast it with their ``button box" of examples to help find compelling, but consistent, force profiles.

\begin{quote}
    \qquote{P5}{[We] provide differentiated tactile experiences to our customers, who are major mobile phone manufacturers. Since Android is pretty generic across the board, um, they like to have custom themes, which are sets of these 150 effects}.
\end{quote}

\noindent With software libraries, themes are essential to the haptic design process.
This desire for consistent output has a tension with customization and fine-tuning:
\qquote{P5}{it's also important to tune the experience depending on whatever kind of motor they decide to put in}.
% \qterm{P1}{look for alarms that were different; branding. effective, but different.}
This is part of the persuasive capability of haptics:

% P5: P5: um, yeah sure, so I would say one of our, most notable recent projects  in touch screens was, um, the addition of haptics to the Android UI stack? so basically we were trying to figure out how to extend the value of confirmation haptics from buttons to other interactions in the Android UI, and we did this by going in and actually modifying Android itself so that we could enable haptic feedback on lists, uh, drop down menus, swipes, all the various interactions, um keyboard and so forth? um, something like 150 different interactions are enabled on this particular project, and the thing that we used this for is being able to provide differentiated tactile experiences to our customers, who are major mobile phone manufacturers, and so since Android is pretty generic across the board, um, they like to have custom themes, which are sets of these 150 effects, available for each of their devices? it?s also important to tune the experience depending on whatever kind of motor they decide to put in

%p1: look for alarms that were different; branding.  effective, but different.



%P5: and so, I think the most memorable day was when we started downloading apps, and realized that, yes, in fact this does work, and not only does it work but it works pretty well for a variety of apps, and it was a couple of surprising apps that it worked really well for, and basically we ended up just sticking those in our demo suite even though we had no relationship whatsoever to the developer ? so, their app just worked, and it worked really well


%P5: P5: sure. Well I mean, people building mobile phones are trying to, the cost pressures are pretty extreme, right, so, in the US most mobile phones that are high-end phones cost $199 on contract, that?s sort of a fixed price? and you can add more features to the phone, but that just reduces the profit margin, right? and the purpose of the OEM, or their business model is to increase that margin as much as possible, while remaining competitive? and so, the addition of haptic feedback technology is always, not always, but can be a tough sell, in terms of going up fidelity, for example.? right? so we would argue to them that the end-user is going to prefer this quality of experience, um, if the additional cost to the bill of materials is significant, then that?s a tough argument to make, versus the OEM saying we?re just going to put this cheap, poor quality motor in the device, and it, you know, you get your vibration alerts when somebody calls, and that?s good enough, you know? which from our perspective is not a sufficient end-user experience


% P6: Take into account fashion and consumer electronics; what does one associate with quality.  Let this influence.


\themeHeading{CC5}{``A tough sell"}{Overcoming risk and cost}
% \inlineHeading{``A tough sell" -- Overcoming risk and cost}
Despite its value, haptic technology is a risky, costly feature to add.
Providing improved user experience requires \qqquote{high-definition haptics}, not \qquote{P3}{some rumble feedback that has been around a long time}.
This often meants \qqquote{going up fidelity} from a \qquote{P5}{cheap, poor quality motor}.
P5's company argues that \qqquote{the end-user is going to prefer this quality of experience} with improved hardware, like a piezo actuator.

\begin{quote}
    \qquote{P5}{[If we were to perform this project again,] I think we would spend a bit more time up front articulating the value, the specific value prop, of individual features}.
\end{quote}


\noindent P5 notes the challenge of convincing non-end-users to buy or deploy their technology:
\qquote{P5}{[our company] has the unique challenge that our customers are not the people who use our products}.
Since the main benefit is to UX, it's challenging to connect to the bottom line, especially compared to other haptics components.
Designers need to \qquote{P3}{get up to the decision making level and more on the business side...[business roles] know nothing about technology, I mean, they don't care, but we are trying to demo parts to them, present business cases to them, and show them what they can do in order to gain market share,? or increase their retail price when they add our technology}.


\begin{quote}
    \qquote{P3}{Let's assume we were to work on a completely different product like memory chips, so? everybody understands what this is for, what it can do, and you probably have a memory chip that is faster or, whatever, smaller. Now for haptics, this approach is kind of difficult because the technology scouts themselves they kind of understand what this is for, but how it it's going to add value to their device, and how much they can increase the retail price, or if they can increase it at all, or gain market share, that's completely open}.
\end{quote}






% \qquote{P3}{I think the technology today is, is really at an early stage, it's probably when you compare it to graphics, uh, it might be 30 years behind graphics, or maybe I'm too pessimistic there but ? but that is still really new}



\noindent Newer technologies are hard explain: \qquote{P5}{[gesture-based haptic feedback is] a much more complex task to design, and also to explain, to the OEM}.
It can also make persuading a customer difficult.
%, because they are more concerned with the bottom line.
P3 finds that there is always \qqquote{there's always discussions on the cost}, and despite
\qqquote{proposing also alternative business models} like contracts \qqquote{you pay over two years for your phone}, \qquote{P3}{nobody really signed up}.
This is perfectly captured by P5:

\begin{quote}
\qquote{P5}{`We love [the piezo demo], it feels great, we're building this phone that has a 10 cent eccentric mass motor in it, can you make it feel the same?' The answer of course is no}.
\end{quote}
% \begin{quote}
%     \qquote{P5}{we'll often get the OEMs who will say, well you showed us your piezo demo, and we love it, it feels great, we're building this phone that has a, y'know, 10 cent eccentric mass motor in it, can you make it feel the same? Right, and the answer of course is no.}
% \end{quote}

\noindent P5 notes that \qqquote{cost pressures are pretty extreme}, mobile phones in the US cost \qqquote{\$199 on contract, that's sort of a fixed price? and you can add more features to the phone, but that just reduces the profit margin, right?}, so \qquote{P5}{the addition of haptic feedback technology...can be a tough sell}.
Haptic technology is especially risky because of previously discussed challenges: it involves separate risk-adverse engineering divisions, and changes to the \qqquote{guts} of a product.
Designers need to set up complicated demos to persuade decision makers of the value of improved user experience: \qterm{P1}{if only compete on cost; then this is tough}.
Of course, \qqquote{it's hard to get through to the right level}, like \qquote{P3}{C-level kind of persons, so, talking to the CTO of Sony, those kinds of people}.
The combination of high-risk, increased cost, and tenuous connection to the bottom line make haptics a very tough sell indeed.


%P3:  now in some companies that works well in other companies uh, you, it?s hard to get through to the right level, I mean, I?m talking about c-level kind of persons, so, talking to the CTO of Sony, to those kinds of people, those are the people that can really make a difference and say well, you guys work on this or you don?t? if you try to go through the technical levels from a technology scout to a technical manager and then maybe to a senior manager, you usually get blocked with something that, that you, because nobody wants to take the risk or the blame if it?s not as good as they think, and uh, also they don?t have the business view, the engineers look at it from a perspective well I?m going to take a risk if I change something in my design, and if it doesn?t work everybody?s going to blame me? so why should I do this, unless somebody tells me to do it, I?m not going to do it. So, that?s basically the situation




% \qquote{P3}{Now um when you, let's assume we were to work on a completely different product like memory chips or so everybody understands what this is for, what it can do, and you probably have a memory chip that is faster or, whatever, smaller, um now for haptics, this approach is kind of difficult because the technology scouts themselves they kind of understand what this is for, but how it it's going to add value to their device, and how much they can increase the retail price, or if they can increase it at all, or gain market share, that's completely open because haptics is still, well let's say high-definition haptics, I'm not talking about some rumble feedback that has been around a long time um}
% \qquote{P3}{yeah, yeah they, um, they are mainly looking after having better graphics and faster graphics, online capabilities, and adding sort of a hardware feature to their device in the beginning is mainly adding cost to it, and uh they have to go over uh, get over that hurdle to know whether the cost can be justified by the better user experience, and uh, as long as the content is not created, that is hard to do}

% \qquote{P3}{we are trying to demo parts to them, present business cases to them, and uh show them what they can do in order to gain market share, uh? or increase their retail price when they add our technology}


%However, this can pose a barrier - the customer is not the end-user, but rather the manufacturer. P5's company has to balance both stakeholders, tricky when the main sell of haptics is the *user experience*.

%%quotes about risk, tech staff
% ?	?also they are taking an additional risk because they are changing something through the hardware, it might not appear like that when you look into uh, the consumer electronics industry and you get the impression every other month they have a new phone or new, new kind of, new design, but the guts of it do not change much,  (laughing)? P3




%P1:  Human Factors -- usually how effectively how users interact w/ goals; first job w/ air force.  important in the world, what they pay attention to.  don't know what's import.  interesting analyzing real-world streams; underlying perceptual dimensions are all similar.  work in GE global design; improve comfort and differentiate based on branding (if only compete on cost; then this is tough).

%P3: people really don?t know what to do with it and I think within the haptics community we need to make sure that we don?t lose our breadth and have enough um, kind of resources to continue to at the moment rather push it into the market, but once it?s there I think it?s, it?s going to be, going to add to the user experience and will be a standard feature in the future, it?s like? like having a touchscreen now on smartphones which nobody expects any other way anymore uh, it?s just, I mean it happens to me that I sometimes pull out my old, uh, tom-tom navigation device in my car and I, I uh, and that one didn?t have a touch screen back then (laughing) so I tap on that one and so it?s the same thing with haptics, at some point it?s just going to expect that you get some nice haptic feedback and uh, but uh getting there is still a couple of years out, so, I think

%P3: P3: um, so there?s the typical approach that uh, these big companies, like Samsung and Apple and HTC and Sony, where they are, their approach is to have technology scouts reaching out to you, and uh looking at your demos and then eventually kicking off a feasibility project. Now um when you, let?s assume we were to work on a completely different product like memory chips or so? everybody understands what this is for, what it can do, and you probably have a memory chip that is faster or, whatever, smaller, um? now for haptics, this approach is kind of difficult because the technology scouts themselves they kind of understand what this is for, but how it it?s going to add value to their device, and how much they can increase the retail price, or if they can increase it at all, or gain market share, that?s completely open because haptics is still, well let?s say high-definition haptics, I?m not talking about some rumble feedback that has been around a long time um ? but that is still really new, and therefore, we are trying um, to rather get up to the decision making level and more on the business side, so those are people that are uh, to say it a little bit black and white, they know nothing about technology, I mean, they don?t care, but we are trying to demo parts to them, present business cases to them, and uh show them what they can do in order to gain market share, uh? or increase their retail price when they add our technology

% P3: also they are taking an additional risk because they are changing something through the hardware, it might not appear like that when you look into uh, the consumer electronics industry and you get the impression every other month they have a new phone or new, new kind of, new design, but the guts of it do not change much,  (laughing)

%P5: yes, definitely. Yeah it?s a much more complex task to define- to design, and also to explain, um those to uh to the OEMs
%P5: yeah, um, let me see? I think we would uh, spend a bit more time up front, articulating the value, the specific value prop, of um individual features, instead of,? I would say the approach we took was more, hey it looks like we can do this and it looks like it?s interesting, so let?s do it? right, which is kind of the engineering approach to product development, and I think, to do it again, wouldn?t require unlimited resources, it would require a bit more up-front time around thinking through where the best places to do this, and how can we best show that value, um in the user experience
%P5: P5: well, (company) has the unique challenge that our customers are not the people who use our products? interviewer: yeah (laughing) ? but, so there?s, yeah, so there?s medium and you have to meet the needs of both, I mean if you meet the needs of your, um, your front-line custom-, well your customers, then, their users, if they don?t like it then you?re going to have problems later on too
%P5: P5: sure. Well I mean, people building mobile phones are trying to, the cost pressures are pretty extreme, right, so, in the US most mobile phones that are high-end phones cost $199 on contract, that?s sort of a fixed price? and you can add more features to the phone, but that just reduces the profit margin, right? and the purpose of the OEM, or their business model is to increase that margin as much as possible, while remaining competitive? and so, the addition of haptic feedback technology is always, not always, but can be a tough sell, in terms of going up fidelity, for example.? right? so we would argue to them that the end-user is going to prefer this quality of experience, um, if the additional cost to the bill of materials is significant, then that?s a tough argument to make, versus the OEM saying we?re just going to put this cheap, poor quality motor in the device, and it, you know, you get your vibration alerts when somebody calls, and that?s good enough, you know? which from our perspective is not a sufficient end-user experience
%P5: P5: right.? and, we?ll often get the OEMs who will say, well you showed us your piezo demo, and we love it, it feels great, we?re building this phone that has a, y?know, 10 cent eccentric mass motor in it, can you make it feel the same? Right, and the answer of course is no.
%P5: yeah, well, the bigger, I think the bigger problem is, haptics is a systems solution, it?s not a specific component you put in a system, so the motor is one of the biggest contributors, but so is the amplifier and the communication bandwidth between the amplifier and the CPU, and the CPU processing power for controlling the haptics, and the latency between the sensor and the CPU, all that stuff affects the experience? and, unfortunately, each of those components is handled by a completely separate division of an OEM.

% P3: yeah, yeah, I mean, it would be, it would be sometimes discussion, I mean there?s always discussions on the cost, and we have been proposing also alternative business models but basically uh, that uh, ? I mean, you can think about business models that are similar to like when you buy, when you sign up for a mobile phone or so where you don?t pay for the phone, it?s uh, or at least you don?t pay the total price, and you kind of sign up for a contract and so you pay over two years for your phone, we had kind of, that kind of proposal that would have been a bigger change but um, nobody really signed up for that one so



%P5: P5: sure. Well I mean, people building mobile phones are trying to, the cost pressures are pretty extreme, right, so, in the US most mobile phones that are high-end phones cost $199 on contract, that?s sort of a fixed price? and you can add more features to the phone, but that just reduces the profit margin, right? and the purpose of the OEM, or their business model is to increase that margin as much as possible, while remaining competitive? and so, the addition of haptic feedback technology is always, not always, but can be a tough sell, in terms of going up fidelity, for example.? right? so we would argue to them that the end-user is going to prefer this quality of experience, um, if the additional cost to the bill of materials is significant, then that?s a tough argument to make, versus the OEM saying we?re just going to put this cheap, poor quality motor in the device, and it, you know, you get your vibration alerts when somebody calls, and that?s good enough, you know? which from our perspective is not a sufficient end-user experience

%P5:  and actually what ended up happening is that, we moved all of that functionality into a different product line, um and so now the basic product just has what I would call static confirmation style haptic feedback, although it?s across a variety of locations in the UI, so maybe 120 or so different places where you have, you know, confirmation style haptics? and then, we have a forthcoming product which will have all of the sort of dynamic haptic experiences, that are gesture driven
%P5: yes, definitely. Yeah it?s a much more complex task to define- to design, and also to explain, um those to uh to the OEMs
%P5: uh yeah, it?s a bit more complex for us, but the product actually, ships as a diff tree, to Android, so the customer just has to run a script um and it will patch all the changes into Android
%P5: P5: yeah, um, let me see, I think we would uh, spend a bit more time up front, articulating the value, the specific value prop, of um individual features, instead of,? I would say the approach we took was more, hey it looks like we can do this and it looks like it?s interesting, so let?s do it? right, which is kind of the engineering approach to product development, and I think, to do it again, wouldn?t require unlimited resources, it would require a bit more up-front time around thinking through where the best places to do this, and how can we best show that value, um in the user experience

%P5: Oh sure, I mean you can make that argument, yeah, I mean, you can, you reduce cost, you reduce complexity, you reduce failure rates, all the stuff goes down, but the, the, problem in many cases is that the manufacturer doesn?t have the domain expertise or the process infrastructure to manufacture a haptic solution that?s, as compelling as a mechanical switch panel.



%P3: ideally you don?t even ship it back to them, you ship it back to your sales rep, and the sales rep knows how to operate it and goes back to the customer in a face-to-face meeting, shows it to them, and then they can take it from there, show it internally, especially when they go up the ranks, show it to a CTO or, that kind of person, that they actually become an advocate and feel comfortable with showing the prototype

%P3: P3: yeah, yeah they, um, they are mainly looking after having better graphics and faster graphics, online capabilities, and adding sort of a hardware feature to their device in the beginning is mainly adding cost to it, and uh they have to go over uh, get over that hurdle to know whether the cost can be justified by the better user experience, and uh, as long as the content is not created, that is hard to do

\section{Broad-Spectrum Follow-up: Workshop Findings}
\label{sec:workshop}
\noindent
Here we report the findings from a workshop on haptic experience design at World Haptics 2015, a major academic haptics conference (\url{http://haptics2015.org}). 
The workshop was organized by some of the authors % with the intent 
to initiate a conversation between researchers and industry practitioners about \haxd, and elicit feedback on our findings to date.
Four leading haptic design experts gave talks which set the stage for a brainstorming session, culminating on a panel discussion about challenges and ideas for \haxd.
% At the end, a questionnaire was distributed.
Over thirty participated in a workshop brainstorm session and panel discussion.
Sixteen participants responded to a questionnaire at the end, which requested details about respondents' roles, tools, and techniques (Section~\ref{app:questionnaire}).
In the following, we supplement the quantitative questionnaire results with the qualitative data gleaned from this venue -- open-ended questionnaire responses and themes from the brainstorming session and panel discussion.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Subsection: Quant Questionnaire Results
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Quantitative Results: Tools, Background, Groupwork}
%
\noindent
Of 16 respondents, 5 self-reported as working in industry, the other 11 as members of academia (one of whom also reported also working at ``other: research institute").
As roles, 4 reported as graduate students, 4 as developers, 2 as designers, 2 as a combination of designer and developer, 2 as researchers, 1 as a business person (``product integration/commercialisation"), and 1 did not respond.


\begin{figure}[tb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ToolResults-2016-06-29}
    \caption{Responses for tools used in haptic design (N=16, \emph{``check all that apply"}).}
    \label{fig:questionnaire:toolcounts}
\end{figure}


Respondents reported a wide variety of hardware and software tools used to work with haptics (\autoref{fig:questionnaire:toolcounts}).
Most used were popular general or technical programming languages like C/C++, Matlab, Java, and hardware hacking tools like Arduino and 3D printers.
Force-feedback APIs for consumer hardware (Geomagic Touch CHAI3D, H3D) were moderately used.
Very few respondents reported using scripting or web tools, like Python, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or more specialized tools.
This combination suggests needs for for performance, technical or scientific libraries, and an ability to tightly access prototyping hardware;
while (in contrast to may other media design domains) web tools use is notably low. 
The latter is not particularly surprising for design that is, by itself, not primarily visual, and often comes with tight timing requirements. %a close relationship with prototyping hardware.
% \osC{slc}
% OS 2016.03.27 I'm curious how this compares to other fields of design, development, or technical work; the absence of web tools is striking but not surprising. Maybe it's because more people come from an engineering or psych background rather than CS or design.


Evaluation techniques were also varied (\autoref{fig:questionnaire:evaltechniques}); 
many respondents listed several.
Most common were methods deployed in-lab or in-house (piloting, laboratory studies).
Less common but still used were more externally valid evaluations (\emph{in situ} studies and real-world deployment).
Quantitative and qualitative methods were reported with equal frequency: 8 participants reported using both, i.e., a mixed-methods approach.


Group size reports suggested that hapticians work in groups with varying sizes (\autoref{fig:questionnaire:groupsize}).
Few work in large groups; just one person (the designer/developer for a research institution) reported a group size of 21-50,  no one reported a group of size 11-20,
and most reported working with 3-5 others.
Five participants reported varying group sizes (combinations of 1, 2, and 3-5 people).
Because our question did not precisely define the meaning of a ``group'', we note the possibility of interpreting it with differing degrees of collaborative closeness, but assume that it was generally regarded as meaning the sharing community within one's organization.

\subsection{Qualitative Results: Consistency, Quality, Value}

Qualitative responses from free response questionnaire questions highlighted three challenges for haptic design:
%% KM 16.14: by 'qualitative responses', do you mean written on questionnaire? Reader could use a reminder of where this came from. The list doesn't sound like things people would say in conversation. Maybe in a panel, but the panel wasn' defined.
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Universal design}: \qqquote{universal experience}, \qqquote{adopting wide spectrum of users}, \qqquote{optimal and consistent delivery of haptic cues to large number of people}, \qqquote{users variations in terms of subjective analysis}, \qqquote{common haptic experiences, any person/any device}, \qqquote{the spectrum of perception}.

\item \textbf{Evaluating quality}: \qqquote{what is `good enough'?},
\qqquote{modeling haptic quality of experience},
\qqquote{appropriate fidelity force feedback},
\qqquote{optimal and consistent delivery of haptic cues...}.

\item \textbf{Value}: \qqquote{getting people to realise the benefits of good haptics. Finding new ways to use hi-fidelity (wide bandwidth) haptic feedback to enhance UX},

\qqquote{merging the technologies, make safety and pleasure experiences},
\qqquote{convincing it's useful}.

Other comments include emotion (\qqquote{transfer emotion through haptics}) and language (\qqquote{haptic language; no simplicity in generating new sensations}).
When asked to what they would like to see in a design tool to overcome these challenges,

\noindent
Brainstorming occurred in 6 groups, who tried to identify challenges faced by members of each group, then brainstorm solutions.
Many of these challenges mirrored questionnaire results.
Three groups (G1,2,6) focused on the \textit{value} of haptics: what is the point or goal in certain situations, and how to market haptics.
One group (G3) tackled the problem of \textit{examples of good design}, including hardware and software architecture, suggesting a repository like GitHub or software engineering patterns.
Three groups (G4-6) talked about \textit{meaning} -- and subjectivity therein, including the possibility of a shared or useful language.

The follow-up discussion developed these challenges further. 
Emergent themes were that
% reinforcing that 
haptics is not well marketed and that touch is taken for granted. The word ``haptic" might be too jargonny or poorly understood; perhaps other terms like ``tactile effect" or ``physical effect" could be more useful.
Curated examples and an online repository were offered as valuable goals.
% seemed like valuable goals as well.

\section {Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}
\noindent
%
To synthesize takeaways out of our findings, 
we begin by describing critical activities practiced by haptic designers, showing that \haxd is already a subfield of design.
We then identify major challenges encountered in \haxd that are unique to or exaggerated with haptic experiences.
We conclude with several concrete recommendations to support \haxd in the future, and a vision for what it might look like.

\subsection{Activities of Haptic Design}
From this work, and previous work on HaXD tools, we suggest the following activities that haptic designers conduct, all familiar to designers in other fields.

\begin{description}
    \item[Develop and communicate vision.]
    Designers must articulate the value that their designs can bring to both end-users and customers.
    They must communicate value to their team and others, and critically, \textbf{persuade external stakeholders} that their product will contribute to the bottom line.
    To do this, they must \textbf{collect, run, and tune demos}, a critical part of the communicative toolkit for haptic designers.
    
    \item[Prepare for design.] Designers need to \textbf{divine requirements} from customers, which customers often do not understand themselves.
    Designers also \textbf{gather examples}, both to provide inspiration and facilitate communication.
    Designers need ways to capture, modify, manage, find, use, and share examples and ideas, both ones they develop themselves and ones they seek out for inspiration.
    
    
    \item[Iteratively develop multiple concepts.]
    Our designers needed to iterate, often with their clients' or users' feedback to really find the right designs.
    Design thinking and UCD are both important to apply to haptics, especially because requirements are difficult to understand.
    % Both \textbf{sketching} and \textbf{refinement} are needed.
    Additionally, designers must either \textbf{communicate with engineering},
    articulating requirements to receive new physical prototypes, or \textbf{have engineering skills} to create demos and prototypes themselves.
    During iteration, designers must also \textbf{evaluate designs and collect feedback}, although this practice is currently limited.
    Both informal feedback from colleagues, and formal studies, typically run by a UX/research division.
    
    \item[Interface with research.]
    Designers need to hand off prototypes or stimuli to their user research division, and communicate study goals.
    They must also interpret results from studies from multiple sources: marketing research, feedback on prototypes and stimuli, and monitor the academic research in this rapidly changing field.
    Alternatively, as with engineering, they might \textbf{plan, run, and analyze studies}  directly.
    
    \item[Manage IP.]
    Designers need to be sensitive about intellectual property, both that of their company's technology, and of the many companies and divisions they interact with.

\end{description}




\subsection{Challenges for Haptic Design}
\noindent
%
From our participants' themes, we identify several challenges facing designers that are unique or exacerbated when working with haptics.

%\kmC{slc} %% KM 06.14: surprised not to see something emerging here about hardware diversity and individual differences (hard to please different people with one thing).

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[\textbf{C1}] \textbf{Context is Unknowable.} % \textbf{Unknown Context.}
    Haptic experiences are multimodal and vertical, interacting closely with physical hardware, grip, and orientation.
    When our participants knew the haptic experience's context, even when it gave constraints like avoiding visible feedback, they were able to use reinforcement and substitution to improve their sensations.
    However, when the context is unknown, either from not having access to relevant intellectual property or due to diverse environments and grips, designers are very limited, especially when trying to create consistent experiences.
    As P5 said, there's not much you can do other than assigning a volume control.
    
    \item[\textbf{C2}] \textbf{Individuals Vary.} % \textbf{Individual differences.}
    Another unknown factor is how the user perceives, understands, and responds affectively to a haptic experience.
    Different people, who experience perceptual differences based on age, sex, and their need-for-touch, will have different responses to a haptic sensation.
    More over, their past experiences affect how they will interpret a sensation, e.g., feeling a vibration as a cat's purr or a car's rumble.
    This has both an effect on end-users and on customers, as each application area needs the haptic technology to be tailored, hindering production at scale.
    
    \item[\textbf{C3}] \textbf{Demos are complex, costly, and crucial.} % in-person.}
    Despite being essential in communicating with stakeholders and persuading customers, demos are hard to set up (many moving parts and ways to fail), and often require a dedicated assistant.
    Latency is a special challenge for early prototypes, which can defeat the prototype's objective of trying out the experience.
    However, haptic design takes place internationally and through different organizations; between secrecy concerns and remote collaboration, we can't always have someone present to nanny a demo.
    Once set up, however, they seem to be effective, especially if they are tunable or customizable.
    
    \item[\textbf{C4}] \textbf{Iteration is painful.} % \textbf{Painful iteration.}
    Every change to a haptic experience results in a change to the ``guts", including reinforcing modalities and physical setup.
    Tight technical constraints, like low latency, need to be followed to be effective.
    This means that iteration is slow and difficult.
    However, customers and users don't understand requirements without trying ideas, and haptic technology must be tailored to each application.
    Thus, rapid iteration or parallel development is essential to get things feeling ``just right".
    Despite this, iteration remaines painful; special care is taken by our designers to allow for easy tuning, but better solutions remain to be seen.
    
    \item[\textbf{C5}] \textbf{Cost/benefit ratio is not persuasive.}
    Haptic technology, ironically, often provides  intangible benefits: better user experience, branding, and sense of quality.
    Designers are tasked with persuading phone and car manufacturers of better user experience, rather than users themselves.
    Improving haptics comes with increased cost and risk, often is communicated through risk-adverse engineering avenues; all the while, it is hard to relate to the bottom line of increased revenue or profit.
    Lack of infrastructure, public knowledge, and ability for people to say what they need means we need to establish haptics more prominently in the public consciousness.
    
    \item[\textbf{C6}] \textbf{Barriers to interdisciplinary collaboration are significant.}
    Haptic design is extremely multidisciplinary.
    Because of this, our designers either need to fill many roles, or work in groups that include hardware, software, business, and psychology.
    Making skills, including engineering, are especially valuable but often segregated from the central design group.
    Especially because haptic technology needs to be tailored to each problem, we cannot design once and forget and need to maintain multidisciplinary groups.
    
    \item[\textbf{C7}] \textbf{Evaluation methods are limited and often inaccessible.}
    Haptics provides intangible benefits like better quality of experience or branding, which are difficult to study.
    Further, although many of our designers mentioned evaluation methods as important, time constraints limited how much evaluation is conducted.
    Typically, acceptance testing seemed to be the primary result.
    In our workshop, we found both qualitative and quantitative methods were used, but \emph{in-situ} evaluations were difficult to come by, suggesting that haptic designers primarily conduct evaluations in-lab and do practical deployments %., but not analytics or context-based investigation.
\end{enumerate}



\subsection{Recommendations for Haptic Design}
\noindent
%
From these challenges, we identified several directions for development and support which % implications that 
could lead to better haptic design in the future.

% \kmC{Consider a figure with Challenges on one side mapping to Recommendations on the other side.}

\begin{enumerate}

    \item[\textbf{R1}] \textbf{Closed loop control for consistent performance.} %\textbf{Sensors and closed loop control.}
    % One approach for consistency in unknown context (C1)
    % %, and perhaps to accommodate individual diefferences in grip (C2),
    % is to reduce external noise in dynamics.
    To guarantee specific perceivable outcomes in an unknown environment (C1), sensing and control theory can be applied to drive actuator output to desired levels.
    For example, by sensing the external vibrations of a VT actuator with a microphone, its output can be modified to overcome the effect of external factors like material, orientation, and grip and achieve a specified frequency, amplitude and responsiveness. %OS comment 06.06 argue for machine learning, place in context of other trends.
    

    \item[\textbf{R2}] \textbf{Easy demonstration and sharing.} %Prev: Easy calibration
    %\kmC{slc} % I'm a little unclear on point of the difference between calibration and customization. I believe you're getting at making it easy to try things out, i.e. "sharing" design stage; but the operations you describe sound a lot like customization. Perhaps this one just needs to be set up differently. Maybe the tag line should be "easy demonstration and sharing", with calibration being just a means to that end?
%
    When exploring, demonstrating, and sharing designs is easy, iteration and convergence is faster and best practices propagate 
    -- \eg, evaluation kits where customers and clients can experience demos without a sales representative being physically present to orchestrate the experience.
    But demos that are self-assembled or operable by non-experts require an easy way to troubleshoot and ensure calibration.
    We therefore recommend development of automatic or facilitated calibration of demonstrations to support unknown contexts (C1), individual differences in perception and preferences (C2), and streamlined demo sending, setup and quality assurance (C3).

    % Similar to sensing context, we also recommend putting effort into automatic or facilitated calibration of demonstrations to support unknown contexts (C1), individual differences (C2), and the difficulty for setting up, sending, and ensuring demo quality (C3).
    % If demos can be self-assembled, or operated by non-experts, there needs to be an easy way to troubleshoot and ensure calibration.
    % This could help enable things like evaluation kits, letting customers and clients experience demos without a sales rep.
    % However, the advocacy of a sales rep could still be helpful.


    \item[\textbf{R3}] \textbf{Customizable infrastructure.} %\textbf{Customization}.
    \kmC{slc: conflict with rapid prototyping ethic?} % Elephant in the room: this is in direct opposition to quick development. Customizable infrastructure will slow everything down. Can you speak to this?
    Individual differences persist even when context is known (C2).
    We recommend adding customization tools whenever possible, to select options, fine-tune and simply adjust volume. 
    Customizable infrastructures that support fine-tuning can also help speed  iteration once demos or even fully-fledged applications are set up (C4), letting designers and customers try variations of a haptic experience easily.
    % Currently, the best we can do with uncertain context is to add a volume control (C1).
    % Between that and individual differences (C2) which persist even when context is known, we recommend adding customization tools like volume controls, when possible.
    % Develop customizable infrastructures that support fine-tuning can also help speed up iteration once demos are set up (C4), letting designers and customers try multiple versions of a haptic experience easily.
    
    \item[\textbf{R4}] \textbf{Proxies and pre-feels.}
    Proxies are another way to address the complications of remote demos (C3) --
    \eg, low-fidelity feedback like phone vibrations when high-fidelity feedback is unavailable \cite{Schneider2016hapturk}.
    Low-fidelity previsualization of haptic sensations (or ``pre-feels")  \cite{Schneider2015} can improve iteration speed (C4), by allowing the designer to experience an approximation of  an iteration before committing resources to building it, and/or to compare with a reference starting point.
    
    % Another way to address the complications of remote demos (C3) is to use proxies.
    % For example, using low-fidelity feedback like phone vibrations when high-fidelity feedback is unavailable.
    % \osC{Can I mention David Birnbaum's Tactile Videos here or in the workshop?}
    % Similarly, this could improve iteration speed (C4) by having low-fidelity previsualization of haptic sensations (or ``pre-feels"), to imagine an iteration before committing resources to doing it.

    
    \item[\textbf{R5}] \textbf{Hardware pre-simulations.}
    The speed or effectiveness of \textit{mechanical} iteration (C4) can be improved by using software simulations to explore how different electronics components could be rearranged to preserve or enhance dynamics.
    Even more advanced might be the use of simulations to develop ``perceptually transparent" sensations \cite{Ryu2007}, allowing actuators or other components to be swapped in and out if upgrades or cheaper models are available, while software components are automatically updated to achieve a consistent end result. 
    %\kmC{?? slc} % explain why you'd want to swap out hardware components if not to change the feel. Perhaps you'd want to use cheaper components but then the question is whether the same performance can be achieved. The natural approach there would be to run component specs through the simulation, get a yes/no/by how much kind of answer, then verify the best candidates in hardware.  
    This might be best combined with closed-loop sensing (R1) to ensure simulation accuracy.
    
        
    \item[\textbf{R6}] \textbf{Develop infrastructure.}
    As hinted at with other recommendations, we need to develop better infrastructure to explore and deploy haptic experiences.
    Especially to improve the painful iteration cycle (C4), we suggest building infrastructure for developing modular systems, customizable or adjustable demos or environments, and large online repositories of examples, from which we can adapt experiences and build upon previous work.
    Broadcasting haptics %\kmC{defined? slc} % have you defined broadcast haptics? This might be something to put into Background, if it's some kind of  goal or test case that captures a lot of these other objectives. 
    remains an important and unrealized goal, which can help both with potential customers (C3) and end-user experiences.
    
    % \item[\textbf{R7}] \textbf{Find the ``killer app".}
    % \kmC{I don't like this one. slc} % I stopped believing in the "killer app" a long time ago. I really doubt there's ever going to be some single application that will be valuable or popular.. 
    % % furthermore, you think people haven't been on this quest already for 20 years now? As a recommendation, it's sort of like recommending someone to "win big" without any clues about how.
    % % if you must have this, suggest calling it something like a "breakthrough opportunity", and list it not as a recommendation, but a comment at the end where this commonly known thing is reiterated. Try to add some value to it - what properties must this breakthrough application have? A long-time obstacle is that we're mainly finding places where haptic feedback can play a support role, but few where it's essential; the support doesn't justify its cost. For example, wearables are a big deal for haptics because they start to bring together factors where its disadvantages are diminished and it may have value on its own.   
    % To help persuade customers (C5) and promote haptics, there still needs to be a killer application that catches the popular imagination.
    % Although haptics has enjoyed great success in training environments, professional applications like remote surgery, and widespread adoption of basic vibrations, ``personal haptics" has yet to achieve the same motivating traction that was found in personal computing with the spreadsheet. %VisiCalc
    % This need not be an application, it could also be studies that relate the benefit of haptics to the bottom line.
    
    \item[\textbf{R7}] \textbf{Outreach and education.}
    Another way to improve perceived value of haptics (C5), and to facilitate the interdisciplinary communciation required by haptic design teams (C6) is to perform more outreach.
    Having public portfolios, accessible haptics education, support for DIY and maker cultures, and events like hackathons will help to establish haptics as a known term, spread the word about its value, but more importantly help more people join the conversation to find the value in touch-based technology.
    It will help provide different stake holders with common reference points, language, and understanding, both lowering the bar to conduct haptic design as a team member, and by providing a voice to external stakeholders.
    
    
    \item[\textbf{R8}] \textbf{Design theory language.}
    Language especially will be important to develop to help the different team members and clients communicate (C6).
    Much like graphic design, where non-experts might be aware of some concepts (symmetry, contrast, hot/cool colours), and experts know much more (colour combinations, concept of weighting in a visual design) will help teams communicate across divisions and with clients, users, and customers.
    It remains to be seen whether this will be a formal lexicon of terms, or ideas that emerge organically; either way, we suggest paying careful attention to the language used when doing haptic design, and to share the language alongside the sensations and their components.
    
    
    \item[\textbf{R9}] \textbf{Better evaluation tools.}
    Haptic designers have limited access to evaluation tools and techniques that are taken for granted in other modalities, especially \emph{in situ} tools (C7).
    Promising ways of mitigating this handicap is application of remote analytics to haptic design, e.g., logging, machine learning, or qualitative contextual inquiry.
    This may require development of new batteries of haptics-suitable tests, especially ones which target its less objective benefits (\eg, quality and branding), which might in turn help to study perceived value and risk (C5).
%    
    % Evaluation tools were limited, especially \emph{in situ} tools (C7).
    % Using remote analytics, like logging, machine learning, or qualitative contextual inquiry are promising avenues.
    % To do this we may also need to develop new batteries of tests suitable for haptics, especially for its less tangible benefits, like quality and branding,which might help to study perceived value and risk (C5).

\subsection{Future of Haptic Design}
% \noindent
%
% Through this inquiry, we have found two main clusters of findings: how design thinking has been and can be further applied to haptics, and 
% \kmC{adequately covered? slc: intrinsic differences from other fields.} % I'm not sure this last one got very explicitly covered. ???
% Together, these help us develop a roadmap to establishing haptic experience design as its own field.

% \subsubsection{Applying design thinking to haptics}
% \noindent
\noindent Our interviewees followed an observable, defined process.
They collected requirements, developed multiple concepts, and iterated until they arrive at a final experience, which is then evaluated with varying amounts of rigour.
We saw evidence of libraries, examples, and our participants' own craft and experience; we also see a diverse, international, collaborative ecosystem.
Some deliberately applied user-centered design.

However, we also see that haptics \qquote{P3}{might be 30 years behind graphics}, or at least \qqquote{really new}, i.e., in an early stage of development.
% By drawing analogies to other, more established fields of design, we can see areas to improve.
% Hardware is  improving, but we face many barriers from the youth of the field: \kmC{just repeating challenges? low value.}
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item software and hardware infrastructure aren't in place
%     \item limited language with which to talk about requirements, goals, and sensations
%     \item secrecy. by working with novel technology, IP plays a central role hindering collaboration
%     \item Painful iteration cycles
%     \item value proposition not understood
%     \item risk of developing verticality with something new and unproven
%     \item branding, documentation is early stages (how do we talk about it?)
%     \item ...
% \end{enumerate}
%
%
% \subsubsection{What's different about haptics?}
% However, by applying design thinking to haptics, we also find intrinsic challenges tied to the modality of touch, which are not faced by other fields of design.
%
% \kmC{Are these adequately supported by previous sections? I expected more explicit development, based on opening.}
%
% These are:
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item Problem of representation
%     \item Problem of context (ramped up to \kmC{??: ten})
%     \item Problem of multimodality (touch is especially overridden)
%     \item Problem of multiple senses (tactile, kinesthetic) synthesized
%     \item Active exploration
%     \item Verticality - software + hardware, and associated risk and collaborativeness
%     \item interdisciplinariness (from some of the above, also a problem of youth of the field)
%     \item irritation
%     \item customization
%     \item consistency (context + customization/individual differences)
%     \item changes to the guts - can't just swap in new hardware (tied to context)
%     \item another context point: need the entire experience to evaluate, describe, or persuade (multimodality + context + early days)
%     \item ...
% \end{enumerate}
A vision of HaXD as a fully-developed design subfield is exciting, but challenging.
Experience design in general is still finding itself.
However, we believe that HaXD can draw from both newer fields like experience design and interaction design, as well as more established fields like graphic design.
How might it look?

First, haptic designers might work in teams, interacting with other relevant units: creative, product design.
In fact, from our research, it is likely that haptic designers will need to be vertical, communicating with  everyone from mechanical engineers and software development to people conducting business and user research.
As with graphic design schools, there may be formal education available for haptic designers.
However, as haptic technology needs to be tailored to each specific problem, these are more likely to be generalized professional programs that train diverse skills, or will focus on certain sub-categories of haptic technologies, \eg, tactile artists or animators \cite{Schneider2015}, friction designers, or 6DOF force-feedback developers.
As hardware becomes more affordable, we also expect the recent makers movement will encourage hobbyists and artists to explore haptic technology and push its limits, possibly in the near future.

Like other emerging media, \eg, the web browser wars of the 90s, standardization of HTML/CSS, and Blu-Ray vs HD DVD, we expect various file formats and infrastructures to emerge and then coalesce.
Given the diversity of haptic technologies and experiences, we expect these to be centered around \emph{paradigms}.
For example, haptic icons \cite{MacLean2003} are one paradigm: display-only, temporal entities rendered on a single location; these might be designed, distributed, and experienced similar to audio files.
However, tactile animations \cite{Schneider2015} are another paradigm: generalized spatio-temporal entities that can be rendered continuously on different grids.
Multi-DOF force-feedback displays are often programmed with a third paradigm: a virtual environment and a single manipulator; this is most analogous to 3D virtual worlds.
Paradigms can be applied to multiple devices in a class (e.g., tactile animations on grid displays), or multiple paradigms might apply to a single device (a Haptuator \cite{Yao2010}) can display a haptic icon (temporal only), or it can produce a directional force \cite{Culbertson2016} (spatio-temporal).

We expect design dimensions to be further developed, and eventually encapsulated into best practices like alignment, contrast, and weighting used for graphic design.
Other design languages, like musical notation, will facillitate recording and communication amongst experts.
Meanwhile, more developed aesthetic theories, like musical theory or colour theory, will help guide people to effective, pleasing, differentiable haptic designs.
Intellectual property law will need to be adapted - much like a logo can be trademarked, how might a certain button click? 
Whether an haptic icon set be protected, and how to set an appropriate level for burden of proof, remain open questions.
We hope that these questions and more will be answered during this exciting time for one of our most essential senses.



% They will need access to both research and engineering resources, and may need to fill those roles themselves, or communicate effectively with more specialized teammates.
% They will need to develop a vision for an experience, develop initial sketches and concepts, iteratively refine multiple concepts, receive feedback, and communicate that vision effectively with stakeholders.
% They will need to capture, store, and manage examples or candidate ideas, both internally and when trying to browse.
% They will also need to fit their final designs into produce or experiential infrastructure.
% From these challenges, we can start to see the path to a full field of design.

% 1) First, the community should continue to make progress developing hardware, control methods, tools, and exploring psychology and application areas.
% Many very smart people have made excellent progress, and we expect this to continue.

% 2) Next, we need to focus on ways to help the field catch up, focusing on problems of the field's youth.
% What can we learn from recent work in other, more established fields of design, such as ... ?

% 3) Finally, the biggest challenge is in handling intrinsic challenges, which will continue to be revealed as as follow steps 1) (studying the nature of touch and building haptic experiences) and 2) (studying design).
% \osC{Todo: Think hard about this section, it seems like the ultimate capstone for this paper + my dissertation.}.
% \kmC{Agree. Is part of the solution to organize the 'challenges' and 'recommendations' more along the lines of youth/intrinsic lines? What if you discussed both in the context of a 'grand challenge' (or killer app if you must): what makes breakthrough so darn hard? 
% }

%If we are able to do these things, imagine all the people-le-le, living for haptics \osC{Todo: Second part of final capstone, what would a world with haptic design be like, and how could we all benefit?}
