\label{ch:conclusion}

In this dissertation, we explored haptic experience design (\haxd), looking at how to design, build, and evaluate creativity tools supporting \haxd, and looking at the process of haptic experience design.

In this section, we conclude with our findings: A description of the haptic design process, including processes and tasks, strategies, and challenges facing haptic designers, and prescriptive implications for how to design, build, and evaluate \haxd tools.

\section{Description of the \haxd Process}
Our three data collection strategies (depth, breadth, ground) each yield insight into the \haxd process different ways.
Our in-depth studies (Chapters \ref{ch:hapticinstrument} - \ref{ch:macaron}) each contain a focused instance of participants using one of our tools to design haptic sensations, a microcosm of haptic design enabled by our tools.
In Chapters \ref{ch:hapturk} and \ref{ch:applications}, we design haptic sensations directly, gaining insight as designers.
Finally, in Chapter \ref{ch:hapticianinterviews}, we study haptic design directly in the wild.
Of these, Chapters \ref{ch:macaron} and \ref{ch:hapticianinterviews} provide the most insight into the process itself.

\subsection{Processes and tasks}
We found that haptic designers practice design using a familiar process.
In \autoref{ch:hapticianinterviews:discussion}, we showed that haptic designers follow established, principled design processes, with a pre-design preparation step \cite{Warr2005,Schon1982,Warr2005,Shneiderman2000}, iteratively developed multiple concepts \cite{Buxton2007,Hartmann2008}, gather feedback through user research, and collaborate with a number of stakeholders.
These naturally-found results confirm what we found in our in-lab Macaron study, which showed initial preparation from browsing, iteration, gradual refinement, and the development of a repertoire \cite{Schon1982}.
In addition, we found that haptic designers are reflective practitioners \cite{Schon1982}: each new design problem is presented as a unique, and each solution is tailored, novel to adapt to the problem's particular constraints but grounded in the designer's experience.
Much of these process is unsurprising to anyone with HCI or design experience.
However, we found there are strategies and challenges that distinguish \haxd from other fields of design.

\subsection{Strategies}
Haptic experience designers have developed several important strategies to facillitate creativity with haptic technology.

\inlineHeading{Show, don't tell}
We found that demonstrations were critical for haptic designers in the wild.
To help elicit requirements, customers were brought in to try out various demos.
To persuade customers, actually feeling the haptics was critical, if not always enough.
The Haptic Instrument showed evidence for deictic features - what do you think of ``this", which facillitated direct demonstration without having to resort to indirect linguistic descriptions.
In Macaron, exposing the underlying structure of examples lead to improved understanding of how to develop sensations and developed haptic idioms.

%Increasingly in this work, we operate at a phenomenological approach where a haptic sensation is a phenomenon, nothing more or less.
\inlineHeading{Fluid control of low-level parameters}
A viable approach enabled by our real-time tools is an implicit understanding of the sensations by designers, who were able to work with low-level engineering parameters like frequency, amplitude, or even voltage.
In the Tactile Animation study, we found that while animation objects were more used and described are more accessible for non-animators, vector sensations (directly controlling each actuator) were described as useful for finer, expert control.
Learning to control low-level parameters is important for ``high ceilings" in \haxd support tools.


\inlineHeading{Volume Controls}
As found in our interviews with designers, the end-user context is sometimes unknowable.
There is not much designers can do other than putting a volume control on their design to facillitate customization.
In informal discussions with engineers from commercial companies (\eg D-Box), volume controls were a critical, early addition to their haptic chairs.
As explored in our FeelCraft and FeelChat projects, the extra level of volume control is implementable, expressive, reduces footprints, but is more limiting for designers and requires programming expertise.
While there is a great deal of noise in perceptual parameters for high-level controls, careful investigation can improve this \cite{Israr2014,Seifi2014}.

\inlineHeading{Schemas}
Because of the novelty of haptic design, we found that conceptual schemas are important for understanding the intent of haptic sensations.
Schemas are existing conceptual models used as transitionary objects to understanding new concepts \cite{Papert1980}.
We found this procedure occurred not only in educational contexts, but also in design.
In our early Haptic Instrument exploration, we found that our participants' prior experience was a lens through which they interpreted haptic sensations.
For example, one cat-owning participant interpreted likened sensations to cat purring, while another drew more on their knowledge of engines and cars.
Heartbeats and rain \cite{Israr2014} are effects that were easily understand by general participants, and verified using perceptual studies.

\inlineHeading{Narrative Context and Multimodal Reinforcement}
The intent of a haptic sensation was not always interpretable from the sensation itself.
A great deal of the interpretation of an effect depended on the narrative context.
Previous work used linguistic descriptions, such as ``light rain" \cite{Israr2014}.
In our FeelCraft and Feel Messenger studies, we found that linking adaptable sensations to in-game stimuli was effective.
With Feel Messenger, we at first attempted feel effects with abstract icons, such as ``motor" for a rumble effect. 
In early piloting, these were not very helpful for understanding.
Adding in vibrant cartoon emoji icons, and using  a cat's face (for a purr) rather than a motor image were much more effective in sending haptic icons.



\subsection{Challenges}
In \autoref{ch:hapticianinterviews:discussion} we document a series of specific challenges encountered by haptic experience designers in-the-wild.
Here, we comment on higher-level challenges facing designers not fully captured by our interview analysis:
the problems of representation and native platform, iteration, collaboration, customization, novelty and irritation, and risk.

\section{Prescriptive Implications for \haxd Tools}

\subsection{Major Requirements and Features}

\inlineHeading{Soft Features}
Repeatedly, participants asked for ``soft features", associated with more polished tools.
This includes features like copy and paste, undo and redo, saving and loading, grouping, looping, reduced delay, and high-fidelity rendering.
We increasingly found, as we iteratively developed \haxd tools, that these features are more important than getting the right paradigm.
As long as a designer is able to freely and accurately create, they can work around awkward design metaphors.

\inlineHeading{Low barrier, wide walls, high ceiling}
A major goal of our work was to support creativity with haptic technology, and to support low barriers, wide walls, and a high ceiling \cite{Shneiderman2007,Resnick2008}.
We've confirmed that this is critical for \haxd, and found ways of accomplishing it.
As we mentioned, our participants found soft features essential, which helped to free them to make mistakes, explore various options, and provide both accessibility (low barriers) and refinement (high ceilings).
For example, in Tactile Animation, participants found the animation objects easier for exploration and non-expert designers, while vector sensations offered more fine-tuned control.
Similarly, we found the more flexible track-based paradigm used by Macaron to allow for various paths through the interface, and was generalizable to other sensations like simple 1-DOF robots.

\inlineHeading{Paradigms}
First captured in Chapter \ref{ch:hapticianinterviews}, we believe that paradigms is a key concept to designing \haxd tools.
Much like how different programming language paradigms, such as functional or object-oriented languages, can accomplish similar results but enable programmers to think in different ways more appropriate to their problem, we believe that different haptic or multimodal paradigms will enable different problem solving techniques for \haxd.
In our in-depth studies we present three: an instrument paradigm, an animation paradigm, and a track-based editing paradigm.

It is critical to note that there is a many-to-many mapping between paradigms and haptic devices.
Tactile animation can be used for multiple spatial grids and track based editors are generalized enough to handle multiple display types.
Meanwhile, a multi-VT grid could be controlled by any of these three paradigms.
As haptic displays become more diverse, we expect paradigms to play a larger role for organizing design perspectives, and multi-paradigm tools to become successful, just as multi-paradigm programming languages like Python and JavaScript afford flexibility, power, and accessibility - providing increasingly low barriers, wide walls, and high ceilings.


\inlineHeading{Sketching and Refining}
Early in our exploration, we found that our Haptic Instrument, mHIVE, excelled for exploring a design space but faltered for refining sensations.
A real-time direct manipulation model in Tactile Animation facilitated both.
In Macaron, we observed different levels of exploration and refinement, discovering a pattern of focused adjustment and repeated reflection \cite{Schon1982}, where the designers stepped back to feel their design in its entirety, and zoomed in to adjust parts in detail.
We find this is a repeated pattern, where participants iteratively zoom in and out to different levels.
The mixture of focus also depended on the stage of design - early on, exploration and execution take a more prominent role, while later refinement has smaller adjustments and more reflection.

Future work remains to be done to establish whether there are discrete levels of focus, or if it lies along a continuum.
\osC{What about a planning/execution/reflection pattern?}


\inlineHeading{Browsing and Sharing}
From the beginning, we investigated concepts of collaboration [] and discovered the value of repetition and reuse.
In both software engineering and interaction design, there is a strong emphasis to not reinvent the wheel [];
meanwhile, industrial designer Raymond Loewy espouses the need to balance the familiar and the new in design, creating the ``most advanced yet acceptable" design [].

We found the need for reuse become increasingly valuable, both to provide inspiration and guidance for our participants, and 

\inlineHeading{Facilitate Design Languages}
Repetition and reuse is also valuable as a means for haptic design languages.
Much like musical concepts of thematic development, restatement, elaboration, and expectation, or graphical design concepts like contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity, we believe there are important considerations for design language.
Previous efforts have identified frequency, amplitude, rhythm, affect, and spatial location as the main design elements for vibrotactile design.
We have started to identify similar, middle level concepts - alignment and repetition emerged in the Macaron study.
We also find an important design language tool using the concept of schema.

\subsection{Considerations for Implementation}
During our in-depth studies, we looked at three different platforms for implementing \haxd support tools: Android on tablet for mHIVE, Python on desktop for Mango, and JavaScript deployed on the web for Macaron.
From these three implementations, and from attempting to distribute or deploy them, we have found several lessons for implementing interactive software for \haxd support.
Many of these are straightforward applications of software engineering, but we particularly found recently developed web tools to be especially useful when managing the complex interfaces required by design tools.

\inlineHeading{Observer Pattern}
Well established as a design pattern \cite{}, the found the observer pattern was critical in keeping the complex interfaces of our design tools synchronized.
This is especially critical because we need to synchronize haptic, audio, and video playback, and allow implementations through both temporal and spatial means.
In Mango, we implemented this pattern ourselves, but in Macaron, we used React \cite{} which automates the process.
This latter approach was more efficient and facillitated programming.

\inlineHeading{Components and Track-based Editing}
Another valuable approach to develop extensible tools was React's Components, composable interface elements that can be parameterized and reused.
This technique, along with a carefully organized architecture and the generic track-based editor control paradigm used by Macaron made it very easy to extend.
When developing MacaronBit by forking the original code for Macaron, we were able to repurpose the tool to control the CuddleBits in a single day.
While a better paradigm could be designed, our in-lab experts were able to used generalized tracks to create differentiable behaviours from the bit.
One can also imagine redesigning a track-based editor to use a different control paradigm with the same device - we do this with MacaronMix, which mixes two VT icons using again a fork off of Macaron.


\inlineHeading{Flexible, extensible data structures}
Because of the complexity and variance of haptic devices, we needed to establish data structures that were lightweight but extensible.
We used JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) to accomplish this in Mango, Macaron, and FeelCraft.
JSON which allowed us to specify only the required information needed, whether for device parameters in Mango, or sensations created by both Mango and Macaron.
Our tools would check JSON files for designed features - like amplitude tracks in Mango - and ignore others we left in for a stub - like frequency tracks.
These structures were simple, human-readable, ignored extraneous detail, and could gracefully fail when poorly formatted.
Because we need to accommodate different paradigms in \haxd tools, lightweight data types make a lot of sense.

\inlineHeading{Existing data structures like .WAV}
Audio control useful, Arduino connection useful - but how to connect to web?


\inlineHeading{Web Deployment}
One challenge with haptic technology 
Web - more people, online communities, resources, show internal structure
Need to package up software
Documentation for use

\inlineHeading{No Delay}
In interviews with designers, we found that delay was critical; multimodal sensations had to be tightly synchronized.
We found similar problems with our tools.
mHIVE had a short delay which was distracting to participants, particularly when they tried to play very short pulses.
Macaron's real-time audio synthesizer sometimes created a ``muddy" effect (P?) because it had a limited update rate.
We found this disappeared after implemented .WAV exporting function.
Combined with our findings that users would switch between focused, in-depth editing and more reflective experiencing, we suggest (and are working to implement) a pre-feel/render model, like with visual effects tools.
This is one potential problem with current web implementations of our design tools, especially when attempting to communicate to embodied devices like Arduino.


\inlineHeading{Distribution requires hardware}
An obvious, but critical, requirement for \haxd tools is that they require the appropriate hardware.
Above we've discussed flexible architectures and data structures to support different hardwares and paradigms of sensations.
In addition, potential designers need easy access to hardware.
One way we've found is to create do-it-yourself haptic wristbands for Macaron. (URL)
Critical for VT feedback is that amplifiers and actuators matter - we found the DIY custom amplifier we've built does not have the same crispness as a more expensive commercial audio amplifier.
This means that modular systems could be designed for facillitate accessible haptic feedback and design, but are complicated in because the setup doesn't end at the actuator.
Another approach is to use a HapTurk-based translation with mobile vibrations like those available on Android (link to hapticJS), although this impoverishes sensations and leads to the challenge of native platform, discussed above.


\inlineHeading{Logging and Analytics}
One important feature for modern software is remote analytics.
Various types of metrics and usage statistics help developers prioritize development, fix bugs, and report to investors.
Interestingly, because haptic technology extends into the physical world, one can consider using remote analytics both on their design and playback software, and on the physical devices.
With a modular system
Logging and analytics not a problem; should record these features (from Macaron, a little Tactile Animation)



\subsection{Evaluating \haxd Tools}


\inlineHeading{Post interviews}
Early in our investigation, we found that participants found traditional think-aloud [] protocols challenging.
This appeared to be due to a split attention of paying close attention to sensory input on their hand while simultaneously designing sensations.
Even without thinking-aloud, this was cognitively challenging, and participants wanted looping, or would step back to refine and feel their sensations.
In response, we adopted unintrusive logging and post-interviews, both of which were effective in capturing aspects of the haptic design process. 

\inlineHeading{Phenomenology}
Because of the close connection with participant experience, we adopted techniques from phenomenology, both to capture the sensory experience of haptic sensations, and to capture the experience of design.
This perspective was useful for rigorous examination of our participants' interviews and to guide the interview process.
In addition, the practical techniques, considering each meaning unit and clustering them into both in-vivo language and analytical language, very useful, especially when later combined with Grounded Theory techniques.

\inlineHeading{Grounded Theory}
To better equip ourselves to analyze larger sets of data and develop a broader theory, we also drew upon Grounded Theory as described by Corbin and Strauss [].
Especially when analyzing screen-captured video, coding techniques were valuable in identifying countable data, strategies, and adding a second layer of data analysis techniques to complement those provided by phenomenology.

\inlineHeading{Analytics and Logs}
Qualitative analysis of post-interviews provided valuable insight, but only gave a partial view of haptic experience design.
Timing analysis, and visualized logs, captured data that may not have been not have been observed by the researcher, and not reported or noticed by the participant in a post-interview.
Importantly, it also offers a transition into broader data collection at large, providing a sustainable method of observing features


\inlineHeading{Multimodal Design Tasks}
Throughout our three in-depth design tool studies, we refined our approach for participant tasks.
With the initial Haptic Instrument study, we asked participants to freely explore the interface and attempt to design for affective words like happy or sad.
This was challenging for the participants, and we found inconsistent designs. \osC{TODO: what exactly was bad about this?}
In our Tactile Animation study, we used more defined scenarios - a heartbeat, a directional cue for driving, and a sound-based design task.
The first two were effective and descriptive for our participants, but the sound task in particular engaged them; it also gave us controls over theoretical dimensions like complexity or abstractness, impose constraints like careful timing, and was externally valid with the multimodal nature of haptic design.
In our final in-depth study, we adopted animations instead of sounds, with similar results.

\inlineHeading{Ratings}
In our studies, we had participants rate their designs including confidence and difficulty.
We did not find quantitative results from these reports, mostly due to low sample size and the qualitative nature of analysis.
However, we did find it to be useful for two reasons.
First, it provided an elicitation device, inviting participants to comment on the difficulty or their happiness with their designs.
Second, as we scale to more natural settings and higher sample sizes, we hope quantitative findings from rating scales will provide insight to questions about challenge, learning, and flow theory, which emerged from the third in-depth study.


\section{Previous HaXD theory}

   \caption{Planned synthesis of data for a preliminary theory of haptic experience design.}
   \label{fig:haxd:theoryoutline}
\end{figure}


The three case studies provide rich but focused data on how to create vibrotactile (VT) experience design tools.
To complement these studies, I propose to gather information more broadly to generalize the haptic design process to other use cases and ground in haptician experience (\autoref{fig:haxd:theoryoutline}).
%from professional haptic designers.
In this way, my final contributions will draw from several sources: 
1) the three in-depth design studies,
%2) a literature survey of general design theories,
2) insight gathered from several side projects, and
3) two sets of grounded data: interviews with professional designers, and
%4) 
%informal interviews with peers at conferences, and 
a workshop at World Haptics `15.

Here, I describe the data collection process, then illustrate possible applications and forms for these contributions.
However, any resulting theory will be emergent from the data, and can take many forms.
To accomplish this in a principled way, I plan to use \emph{memoing} and \emph{constant comparison} \cite{Corbin2008}, looking for common threads between data and double-checking conclusions as new theoretical developments appear.
%This will be guided with a goal: to characterize haptic experience design, especially any features that are unique to this unique class of technological experiences.
This theory will also draw from a literature review of design theory, summarized in this document's related work section.
%This will provide information about non-haptic design disciplines and general theory of design to help frame our inquiry.

\section{Data Collection}
In this section, I list the different sources I intend to use to collect data for theory design.

\subsection{Vibrotactile design case studies}
Each of the  design case studies previously described investigates a specific user group working on a specific VT device with a specific software tool.
Through my experience of gathering requirements, creating tools (through design and development), and evaluating them, I will have first-hand knowledge of supporting aspects of VT sensation design.
Each also produces a small vignette of haptic design in action, giving us glimpses of the design process.

\subsection{Side projects}
In addition to the three design case studies that form this proposal, several side-projects are planned or underway as collaborative efforts.
In these side-projects, I take an organizational or supervisory role, often as summer projects conducted by undergraduates.

\begin{description}
	\item[FeelCraft and Feel Messenger] are collaborations with Disney Research members Ali Israr and Siyan Zhao, looking at distributing and customizing haptic effects in a consumer setting with low-fidelity rumble motor devices.
	I take a haptic designer role to gain a personal understanding of the process, and a software engineer role to understand relevant architectures. % for distributing haptic media.

	\item[CyberHap] is a collaboration between UBC and Stanford looking at force-feedback devices in education; a large team is involved with undergraduate Gordon Minaker leading development of a teaching interface since February 2015, co-supervised by PI Dr. Karon MacLean and me.
%	I co-supervise Gordon with PI Dr. Karon MacLean in this project looking at force-feedback devices in an education setting.
	
	\item[CuddleBit] is a project inspired by the Haptic Creature and CuddleBot project. A small, breathing and vibrating robot will be designed along with a behaviour prototyping tool in summer 2015.
	I supervise undergraduate Paul Bucci in this project exploring multiple modalities and potential for receiving input through a sensor.

	\item[HapTurk] is a collaboration with PhD candidate Hasti Seifi on different techniques to crowdsource feedback on VT icons. Master's student Salma Kashani and undergraduate Matthew Chun are developing visualizations and low-fidelity VT icons during summer 2015.
%	This project looks at a formal mechanism for doing large-scale feedback, and tackles the problem of cross-device and cross-modal equivalency (can a sensation be rendered in some fidelity on both low- and high-fidelity devices?).

	\item[RoughSketch] is a painting application for the TPad Phone, a variable-friction mobile device, for the World Haptics 2015 Student Innovation Challenge. Undergraduates Brenna Li, Paul Bucci, and Gordon Minaker are all fellow team members. Variable friction is a significant contrast to VT sensations as it is intrinsically connected to input: no sensation can be felt without active movement by the user.
\end{description}



\subsection{Grounded Data}
A corpus of interviews with professional haptic designers has already been collected by UBC alumni Colin Swindells during his PhD, but has never been published.
I will analyze these interviews to further ground our findings with real-world haptic designers.

To complement this %, and because professional haptic designers are rare and difficult to find,
we turn to the research community who do design as part of their work.
The planned Workshop on Haptic Experience Design (http://oliverschneider.ca/HaXD) at World Haptics 2015 will also provide a data source.
At this workshop, 4 experts of haptic experience design will speak, participants will reveal their own design challenges in a brainstorming activity, and the ensuing panel discussion should help illuminate practices and paths for future work.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Possible Format}
While the theory can take many forms, I hope to characterize haptic experience design and contrast it with other design fields, especially graphic and audio design.
I hope to find both descriptive and prescriptive results, including current practices, an identification of challenges uniquely facing haptic designers, and guidelines for designers and developers of haptic design support tools.

\subsection{Descriptive Contributions: HaXD Process as Requirements}
My first goal is to describe the \textbf{processes} employed by haptic designers.
This could manifest, for example, as a catalogue of 
existing haptic design tools,
appropriated tools (e.g., using a sound editor to create VT icons),
techniques (e.g., design philosophies like Haptic Sketching),
resources (e.g., libraries and APIs),
platforms (what devices designers are using),
practices in haptics education (undergraduate or graduate level courses),
and tasks undertaken by haptic designers.

For example, to share of haptic experiences, haptic designers create demos
to spread awareness of haptic research and gain feedback from peers.
%One colleague, upon being introduced to the Haptics Symposium conference, said that the haptics community gets demos right.
This is so ingrained into the culture of haptic research that recently a demo-only conference was launched: Asia Haptics.

Once collecting a description of current practices, I expect we might be able to identify \textbf{challenges} and \textbf{strategies} to addressing those strategies, including the ecosystem of available tools: what is working well, and what is broken.
Using our example of collaboration and demos, we might see that in-person demos are effective, but
remote collaboration or asynchronous sharing is challenging. %, but could offer more frequent collaboration between designers.
Available tools include videos and visualizations of demos to explain concepts in lieu of the demo itself.
%Other challenges might include the great variety of different devices, non-haptic tools appropriated for haptic design, the implementation complexity of dealing with hardware, low-level software, and application logic simultaneously, or the strong influence of other modalities (vision, hearing) on perceived touch sensations.

\subsection{Prescriptive Contributions: Guidelines for HaXD Software Tools}
After describing HaXD as a set of requirements, I will then develop guidelines for how to built supportive interactive software tools.
Right now, I plan to organize this into three aspects: how to \textbf{design} tools, including important features relevant to different stages of HaXD; how to \textbf{build} tools, including relevant software architectures and ways to address technical challenges; and how to \textbf{evaluate} tools, methods to capture designer experience and inform future design.

Hypothetical use cases might best explain this contribution.
One examples is using these guidelines for knowledge transfer to industry.
I could use these guidelines to advise or create design software for companies developing haptic hardware platforms (such as the TPad team and UltraHaptics) or software platforms (such as Immersion and Phidgets), bridging the gap from research to industry application.
Another example could be dissemination through haptics education.
Developing a module for a haptic design course, such as CPSC 543, is an accessible way to encapsulate and test these ideas.
This could also manifest in a multi-day workshop, similar to Camille Moussette's Haptic Sketching workshops, to validate ideas at different institutions.



\section{Deliverables and Risk}
There are two expected deliverables from this theory development.
First, the HaXD'15 workshop on Haptic Experience design is planned, piloted, and scheduled for World Haptics in June, 2015. 
To get the most out of this workshop, photographs and notes will be recorded.
Afterwards, a very small digest piece debriefing the workshop is planned in winter 2016; this may be submitted on its own as an short paper if an appropriate venue is available (e.g., a special journal issue similar to \cite{Jones2014}), or subsumed into the second deliverable.

The second deliverable is a retrospective piece on our findings from all the data sources found here, but with a focus on data from haptic designer interviews.
This interview data has already been collected by UBC alumnus Colin Swindells.
I plan to digest and analyze those interviews in winter 2016 to generate requirements grounded in designer experience.
This will likely be combined with synthesized findings from the three design studies and several side projects.
To mitigate risk, we can combine interview findings to a greater or lesser extent with other data sources.
If the interviews have a great deal of information, they could be a valuable contribution on their own.
If not, I expect them to supplement our other data sources.
This document will likely be submitted as a full paper to a peer-reviewed conference or journal.

Within each project, we mitigate risk through strategic planning and study design;
many of these projects do not have to be successful to provide input.
For example, HapTurk may never actually be deployed, but could still articulate the challenge of a large-scale, remote haptic user study.
In addition,
risk is partially managed through sheer attrition: one or two side projects or data sources could provide limited feedback and we would still have a diverse set of information. 
However, I will note that initial investigation has already been useful.

%
%To ground our other findings with our target end users, and identify challenges that may not emerge from the literature alone.
%The goal is to develop an initial proposed theory of haptic experience design from multiple sources, which characterizes the unique process that can or could support designers.
%I plan to gather information from a variety of sources, including interviews with professional designers, informal interviews with peers during conferences, and the literature.


%The main source of data will be from interviews with professional designers, several of which have been collected already by researcher Colin Swindells.
%These will be analyzed using qualitative techniques like grounded theory and phenomenology \cite{Creswell2013, Moustakas1994}.
%
%A second source of data will be reflection on our own projects and those of our peers and collaborators.
%
%
%Currently, much of the literature review has already been conducted for this document,

%Although haptic technologies have become commonplace in end-user experiences, there are still few established processes to guide designers, who face special challenges that arise out of the relative youth of the field and from qualities intrinsic to the sense of touch.
%Design guidelines, toolkits, and authoring interfaces exist as disparate pieces of knowledge rather than a unified perspective, 
%hobbling the creativity and efficiency needed to create new haptic experiences. 
%In this paper, we assemble key elements of the haptic design process and its
%needs
%into a generalized
% framework and vocabulary, 
%to promote
% a more fluid, extendable, and transferrable understanding of the practice, 
%guide development of effective tools, and 
%promote a discourse around both. 
%We begin with haptic versions of three primary
% design activities identified in
% design theory, creativity support tools, and other fields of design: problem preparation, hands-on design, and collaboration.
%These activities form a framework by which we can organize the haptic design literature and our own experience 
%into specifically defined
%pathways for design, identifying areas for future research and implications for tool development.

%\section{Introduction}
%Haptic technology has become a 
%standard ingredient of user interactions with technology, with the potential to add engagement to media experiences \cite{Modhrain2001, Danieau2014} and ``calm'' everyday interactions \cite{MacLean2009}.
%% No longer restricted to research labs or theme park rides, 
%Carefully designed and expressive haptic feedback is finding its way into commercial devices, most recently the Apple Watch (www.apple.com/watch).

%
%% Despite this growth, 
%Nevertheless, there is no established process for haptic experience design (``HaXD").
%% (HaXD) %OS: We never reuse this, but may want to in future drafts
%% has no established design process.
%% One culprit is the small and fragmented user base:
%Culprits abound. The user base is small and fragmented:
%professional haptic designers are still rare, often share engineering or scientific duties, and tend to be sequestered in companies whose business needs preclude broader interactions % with other designers.
%and complicate observation of design practices by researchers.
%%\kmE{They lack both training in an articulated user-experience design approach, and an interlinked community through which they can consolidate vocabulary and share best practices.}
%It is difficult to translate guidelines from other fields, in absence of analogies to % graphic design's 
%colour % theory 
%or musical theory. % for touch.
%Designing for the sense of touch entails % brings intrinsic design challenges, such as  %as it involves 
%hard-to-prototype hardware and context-sensitive perception~\cite{Hayward2008}.
%
%%However, when attempting to get that ineffable quality of getting something to ``feel right" in a given context, a robust design process can help when prescriptive guidelines fail.
%
%Recently, design thinking applied to haptics \cite{Moussette2012} has added to the literature on HaXD process \cite{Swindells2006}.
%Toolkits \cite{Minamizawa2012,Ledo2012}, effect libraries \cite{Israr2014},  collaborative software \cite{Ruthenbeck2014,Cha2009} and interfaces themselves \cite{Schneider2014} ease production of haptic \emph{effects}.
%However, a systematic, convergent procedure by which haptic \textit{experiences} can be developed
%to meet specific requirements -- which themselves may be hard to articulate -- is elusive, % not well defined, 
%with previous work providing only % isolated elements. % 
%pieces of the puzzle.
%
%In this paper, we aim to situate
%haptic design tasks in a common framework.
%Synthesizing insights from design and creativity literature, we describe
% three critical activities conducted during many types of design: 
% \textit{problem preparation}, \textit{hands-on design}, and \textit{collaboration}, each with
% sub-activities.
%We discuss each in the haptic context to discover what activities are supported and which are not,
%with examples drawn from literature and our personal experience as designers and observers of other designers.
%This design lens
%reveals not only a process, but pathways for more focused investigation, informing the creation of HaXD support tools.

%%\subsection{Challenge: Difficult Problem Framing}
%%The CHALLENGES (unfilled holes):
%%
%%1. Problem Gathering:
%%No Language, limited theory (framing)
%%Complex sense (hard to understand, need to be expert in multiple domains
%%) (repertoire+framing)
%%No language/theory
%%limited ways to capture, render, maintain examples
%
%
%\challenge{Multiple metaphors}
%Despite a steady progression of research on perception,
%there is no agreed upon language for working with haptics \cite{Obrist2013,Okamoto2013,Jansson-Boyd2011}.
%Most authoring tools have relied on fixed metaphors and devices, limiting \emph{framing}.
%Allowing  multiple metaphors or views on a haptic design is one way in which a designer can % would allow the designer to 
%reshape a problem to be easier to solve (reframe it so it matches their \emph{repertoire} or found \emph{examples}).
%Future authoring tools should pursue flexibility or improved abstractness.
%%Abstract metaphors could apply to multiple device classes, .
%
%%Examples:
%%?	Haptic Camera
%%?	Kuchenbecker?s haptic textures
%%?	Libraries
%%?	Feel Effects/FeelCraft
%%?	Ultrasound Examples from Keisuke Hasegawa?s HaptoMime at AsiaHaptics:
%%o	Tried a bunch of waveforms extracted from sound sources in the Komplete audio packagewith my own palm. It?s a pity that there was no systematic procedure to determine what waveform to pick up. My only advice is that it would be good and efficient to construct an experimental system which allows you to test many kinds of stimuli promptly at an early stage in y our researches.
%%?	Need examples from industry
%
%
%
%%\kmC{Isn't this a library not an education problem? SLC} % Not following the focus on haptics education here, as related to repertoire. Can you strengthen the connection? I thought this particular challenge would be more about how designers can capture, organize, find, reuse externally sourced inspiration and examples - essentially, the library problem. Education, and communication with one another, is an important but different challenge.}
%% That said, I am still fuzzy on distinction between repertoire and examples. They both need libraries, don't they? Because there are a lot of them, and the point is re-use. 
%\challenge{Task-based knowledge}
%To build their \emph{repertoire}, haptic designers must learn essential haptics concepts and begin solving relevant problems.
%Haptics courses \cite{Okamura2012, Jones2014} often provide a HaXD practitioner with initial experience.
%Brief, cogent outlines  of haptics knowledge (e.g., \cite{Hayward2007,MacLean2008,Hayward2008,Karam2013}) allow designers to expand their experience in an accessible way, and resources like EduHaptics (eduhaptics.org) link designers to content.
%However, knowledge is still framed with disparate perspectives. 
%The next step is to understand the low-level tasks conducted in HaXD.
%This would enable development of a more focused ``how-to" compendium of knowledge uniting perception, hardware, and software knowledge bases.
%%Ideally, this will link directly to HaXD tasks, but more research is needed to understand the .
%%, but still accessible, source of knowledge; a handbook of haptics knowledge that summarizes perceptual research, lists prominent examples of design, and guidelines for design and development.
%%This need not be a traditional handbook, but could be an online tool, such as a wiki or online course.
%%A proposed handbook might have more content internalized, structured to be handy and self contained, featuring design case studies.
%
%%\emph{Examples}
%\challenge{Manage examples}
%Currently, \emph{examples} exist in several libraries (e.g., \cite{Culbertson2014, Israr2014}), but capturing, organizing, accessing, and transforming them poses a greater challenge for haptic design than for more visually oriented, or even auditory, domains.
%%Excluding progress made by expanding these libraries in scale or in device support, there are key areas we can look for future progress.
%Capturing with a haptic camera  \cite{MacLean1996} is useful, but limited to that camera's target phenomenon.
%Integration of library uploads into authoring tools (e.g., as suggested in \cite{SchneiderAsiaHaptics2014}), would make it easier to grow a set of \emph{examples}.
%Visualizations, searching techniques (like a haptic search engine \cite{Adi2010,Hanamitsu2014}), and browsing techniques will facilitate access.
%%One demoer at a recent conference described his approach to create a tactile effect.
%%He tried waveforms extracted from sound sources in the Komplete audio package, stating ``It's a pity that there was no systematic procedure to determine what waveform to pick up" and wishing for a system to try stimuli at an early stage.
%%with my own palm. It?s a pity that there was no systematic procedure to determine what waveform to pick up. My only advice is that it would be good and efficient to construct an experimental system which allows you to test many kinds of stimuli promptly at an early stage in y our researches.
%%In haptics, we have already done some work on capturing examples, for example, the haptic camera \cite{MacLean1996}, or empirically gather libraries \cite{Culbertson2014}.
%% Some examples or templates are often shipped with toolkits (Verify!), and recently vibrotactile libraries have been developed: Immersion, Feel Effects, or the UPenn surface toolkit \cite{Culbertson2014}.
%%The haptic search engine (asia haptics) is one way of recalling examples.
%Finally, current \emph{examples} are static -- the designer chooses one and adds it to their application.
%%Novel techniques of using examples to create new designs.
%Open, manipulatable formats beyond parameters (like those in \cite{Ledo2012,Israr2014}) or through design galleries \cite{Lee2010a,Marks1997} is an exciting avenue to allow designers to work hands-on with \emph{examples}.
%
%%Originating in the graphics literature, design galleries provide a set of designs similar or different from your current design, letting users take interesting parameters and apply them to their design \cite{Marks1997}.
%%This idea has since been applied to other design fields like web design \cite{Lee2010a}.
%%Given the difficulty of framing with no fixed haptic parameters or language \cite{Jansson-Boyd2011}, example-based design could be a promising avenue for future design tools.
%%It's also been recommended that focusing on rapid prototyping can get around language barriers in haptics \cite{Fogg1998}.
%%To do this, we need to focus on hands-on design of haptics, the second major design activity.
%
%
%
%%Rapid iteration is essential for being able to think by doing; creativity support tools must have a low threshold, high ceiling, and wide walls: accessible to beginners, powerful for complete solutions, and support a wide range of explorations \cite{Resnick2008}.
%%A sketch can have many purposes, but is distinguished from a prototype by being more generative, less complete, and characteristic of earlier design \cite{Buxton2007}.
%
%
%
%
%%Donald Sch\"{o}n's seminal book, The Reactive Practitioner, describes the process of
%%learning skills to be one of reflection-in-action. That is, a pitcher in a baseball game must be able to find their groove. Through a process of subtle adjustment and experimentation, a pitcher adjusts her technique to fit the current, myriad conditions the wind, the current batter, the sun; the list goes on. This process is implicit, and often people find it impossible to articulate. Like the poor centipede, we sometimes find it difficult to realize that knowledge is embedded in our action, and in fact it can ruin our stride. Verbal overshadowing, articulating a wine's taste or a person's face, often weakens our memory unless we've been trained to verbalize those notions \cite{Schooler1990}. Similarly, a haptic designer must adapt to her design project to the current conditions.

%
%
%\challenge{Multiple, parallel designs}
%Ideation and evaluation are partially supported by existing tools.
%Parallel development of interfaces has been applied to physical UIs with Arduino \cite{Hartmann2008}.
%Brainstorming and techniques like A/B testing, comparing two designs side-by-side, have been employed in haptics design tools \cite{Swindells2014}.
%Rapid ideation and evaluation are also supported through better framing tools like design galleries, described in the previous section.
%
%\challenge{Ambiguity, commenting, \& ad-hoc use}
%%Haptic design suffers from slow iteration.
%%Developing a haptic sensation often requires custom hardware, software, and coordination between the two.
%%Further, other senses must be considered, meaning a full stack of hardware to high-level GUI software must be developed and maintained.
%Haptics, involving software and hardware, can require time to iterate.
%Haptic sketching prioritizes rapidly exploring ideas through physical sketches \cite{Moussette2011,Moussette2012}.
%%Sketchinghas been explored recently with haptic design.
%%Sketches are  conducted with whatever material is at hand, often using only lightweight programming or no programming at all.
%Interfaces that capture the spirit of sketching have been shown to support real-time feedback \cite{Hong2013, Schneider2014}.
%%Toolkits provide support for certain tools, but inhibit flexibility and ambiguity, key aspects of sketching.
%While the community is working to use rapid development with more, sophisticated hardware setups, 
%sketching requires other features to be truly useful.
%Ambiguous sketches show only necessary detail or relevant view points, helping a designer work with half-formed ideas questions. %problems, and supports initial framing to final refinement.
%Unfortunately, a haptic sensation requires a physical implementation, which must be exactly specified.
%Good defaults or randomized tools might be valuable - allow designers to specify constraints they understand, and let other details be filled in automatically.
%Sketching should also support annotation and editing -- circling problem areas, writing down related ideas -- and ad-hoc use.  
%With a pen, any napkin is a canvas. Haptics needs napkins too.
%% To truly support brainstorming and feedback, however, collaborative design must be considered.
%
%%Supporting a mobile context with compact tools could benefit sketching.

%%
%%\subsection{Many Device paradigms}
%%The technological dual to Challenge 1 (Touch is a Complex Sense), the devices we use for actuation vary dramatically. Unlike graphics, where we have an established pipeline resolving to a 2-dimensional matrix of colour values, and audio, where  a waveform is eventually rendered (possibly in multiple channels for surround sound), there is no standard paradigm. Every device is necessarily different, as it has a different physical mechanism.
%%Traditionally, haptic devices are separated into force-feedback devices and tactile output, roughly corresponding to proprioception and tactile mechanoreceptors. Both of these paradigms require a different rendering model, with force feedback devices typically real-time virtual environments, while tactile devices are simpler. Within these two classes of devices, paradigms still vary - skin stretch devices [] may require different rendering pipelines than vibrotactile mechanisms. Finally, complexity compounds when multiple devices are used, such as skin stretch with force feedback [cite Okamura lab demo?], multiple devices.
%%The resulting challenge for designers is that, for almost any output device, the designer has to think in a different way, and has to enable the necessary infrastructure – load the right software, etc.. If a switch ever needs to be made to another device, this incurs heavy costs, meaning a device decision must be chosen early and, quite possibly, without feeling the fully developed result.
%%There are paradigms that have an established or possibly simple output paradigm (namely, 3 degree-of-freedom force feedback devices like the Phantom or Falcon), but this only represents one class of output device; this is exactly the challenge that haptic designers and their supporters must face.
%%
%%Framing
%%-	Designers must change their framing for every device they work with, making it difficult to work on multiple projects, transfer knowledge from previous projects on different devices, or organize their data/deliverables.
%%Hands-on
%%-	Simply trying out an idea to choose a device becomes a serious investment. Designers are locked into a platform early on, making it hard to convince stakeholders that, force feedback really isn’t working for an application but a skin stretch device would be better.
%%Collaboration
%%-	???
%%
%%
%%\subsection{Complexity}
%%Not only are there many device paradigms, each one needs software, communication protocols, and different ways of interacting with the control flow of the application. Architectural decisions, like choosing whether to have server, client, or mixed control, must be made for every application case and limit generalization. Similar to the Multiple Device challenge, this adds to initial startup costs, meaning rapid ideation or dramatic changes are challenging. Hardware is often custom or in active development. Ultimately, to create a haptic experience, designers must consider everything from hardware, control and rendering techniques, perceptual considerations, communication protocols, software architecture, GUIs and other multimodal concerns, and the overall experience in spite of that. A full stack needs to be created or maintained when creating a haptic experience, slowing iteration.
%%
%%Framing
%%-	Because of the complexity of running a haptic system, the designer may not be able to change their model for design. Data types need to be shared between different levels of the system, hardware is difficult to swap out.
%%Hands-on
%%-	It’s difficult to try out ideas rapidly, as implementations need to be fully described (sketching relies on partial description)
%%-	Changes to a design are either slow and error prone (if complexity is not handled well), or incur significant initial time and effort constraints (if complexity is handled well at the beginning). If custom software is needed, designers must choose whether to have flexibility or to try ideas out quickly early in the design.
%%Collaboration
%%-	Adding support for collaboration adds additional complexity. Eliciting feedback often needs logging (a cross-cutting concern difficult to add to a system [cite aspect-oriented design]) or multiple versions (something only rarely addressed in today’s software systems [cite juxtapose]); networking for distributed systems only increases complexity.
%%-	Donation can be challenging as well, as a correct build environment needs to be established
%%-	Relation is actually kinda supported well if people are collocated, as you can invite colleagues to try your demo when it works (ignoring the perceived “demo effect” where things break down when you show them to an audience).

%%\subsection{No language or theory}
%%There is no way to talk about haptics, either linguistically, visually, or … . Also
%%In Mindstorms [4], Seymour Papert tells the story of Jim:
%%Consider the case of a child I observed through his eighth and ninth years. Jim was a highly verbal and mathophobic\footnote{Papert uses the term ``mathophobic" for two overlapping concepts: a fear of mathematics (especially
%%in a school environment), and more generally a fear of learning (especially a fear of one or more specific
%%subjects because of a preconception of ineptitude). In this case, he is favouring the first meaning.} child from a professional family. His love for words and for talking showed itself very early, long before he went to school. The mathophobia developed at school. My theory is that it came as a direct result of his verbal precocity. I learned from his parents that Jim had developed an early habit of describing in words, often aloud, whatever he was doing as he did it. This habit caused him minor difficulties with parents and preschool teachers. The real trouble came when he hit the arithmetic class. By this time he had learned to keep “talking aloud" under control, but I believe that he still maintained his inner running commentary on his activities. In his math class he was stymied: He simply did not know how to talk about doing sums. He lacked a vocabulary (as most of us do) and a sense of purpose. Out of this frustration of his verbal habits grew a hatred of math, and out of the hatred grew what the tests later confirmed as poor aptitude.
%%With adult experts in a field, we can assume that they do not lack a purpose. This leaves the vocabulary as a major obstacle, a vernacular of touch that enables us to more clearly talk and think about haptic sensation.
%%Framing
%%-	No language or theory to thinking in when framing the problem
%%-	Hard to organize examples, search them
%%-	
%%Hands-on
%%-	Structuring hands-on transformations is challenging
%%Collaboration
%%-	Can’t talk about haptics, either with collaborators (relating) or providing feedback (evaluation)

%%\section{Designing Haptic Experiences}
%%With these concepts in mind, we review work made to supporting haptic experience design.
%%Through the design lens, we can see progress on some fronts, and outline next steps for future research.
%
%
%\section{Discussion}
%In this section, we illustrate the value of this framework in two ways: articulating scope for a hypothetical tool (``haptic mechanical turk"), and general design implications for a haptic authoring interfaces.
%
%1) Haptic mechanical turk is a hypothetical scenario where Mechanical Turk users can participate in a vibrotactile perception study.
%The users download a mobile app and respond to vibrations, then the app sends the data back to a experimental server.
%This project targets a distributed, asynchronous system to gather \emph{feedback} on vibrotactile sensations.
%It articulates one pathway through the design space, sidestepping some known challenges but confronting others:
% there is no need for synchronous communication or collocated interaction, for problem preparation or hands-on design.
% This guides the HaXD process, presenting device generality as the (non-trivial) problem to be solved.
% %This leaves just device generality as the (sadly non-trivial) problem to be solved,  guiding our process
%
%2) The pathways naturally inform design guidelines, each one advising how to support its corresponding activity.
%For example, we suggest that a haptic design tool should have multiple views, each corresponding to a different mental model (\emph{framing});
%have good default values to support ambiguous specification of sensations (\emph{sketching});
%and have a publishing system in place to distribute sensations (\emph{donate}).
%%So what's the upshot of seeing haptics through the design lens?
%%It....
%%\textbf{todo:} \emph{Here I want to propose two or three projects that are made easier by a good task definition. For example, haptic mechanical turk (like, distributing a VT study over mechanical turk) to support distributed, asynchronous feedback. This is the money section, showing what this framework can do}.
%
%%\textbf{Summarize previous section, synthesize together a little bit} into THINGS THAT ARE GOOD and THINGS THAT ARE BAD AND NEED TO BE IMPROVED; it's a little split up in the previous section
%%
%%Much remains to be done to support the design of haptic experiences.
%%Although perhaps intimidating, there is hope.
%%Progress has been made on isolated fronts.
%%Our hope is that, by applying a design lens to haptics, we can identify new paths for progress that could facillitate the transfer of haptics from research labs to commercial applications.
%%
%%Indeed, haptics practitioners are uniquely strengthened by these challenges.
%%Cross documents the idea of ``design thinking", noting that designers operate seamlessly across different levels of abstraction, from high-level systemic goals to low-level physical properties \cite{Cross2011}.
%%In a recent meeting with interdisciplinary experts, our software engineering colleague was amazed at the way haptics researchers flitted from low-level concerns (USB bandwidth and protocols) to high-level goals (brainstorming interaction design), describing it as giving him a sense of vertigo.
%%With a little inspiration drawn from other design fields, we can turn these obstacles into a unique strength to create a new wave of user experiences.

%\section{CONCLUSION}
%
%In this paper, we presented a framework of activities important for haptic experience design (HaXD), which organizes previous work into a united perspective, provides a vocabulary for design discourse, and illuminates pathways for future research and tools. 
%In future work, we plan on validating this proposed framework in two ways.
%First, we plan on adopting it in our own work, using it to help define future studies, and using those studies to amend or expand this framework.
%Second, we plan on looking to professional designers to provide empirical validation and improvement of the model.
%This is the first step towards a validated model of haptic design tasks and body of knowledge on how to support those tasks through design tools.
%Right now we have proposed a model, now the task is to validate it and also to use it to support the design of engaging haptic experiences.
