In both the Haptic Instrument and Tactile Animation case studies, participants drew from their experience or external examples and requested features for repetition.
%This is unsurprising; creative tasks, like design, are often defined as the recombination of existing ideas, with a twist of novelty or spark of innovation by the individual creator \cite{Warr2005}.
Because we explored haptic design tool implementation and rendering pipeline in-depth in \autoref{ch:tactileanimation}, with Project Macaron\footnote{Published and demoed at Haptics Symposium \cite{Schneider2016macaron}.} we instead move the focus to capturing more of the design process, with example-use as the target phenomenon.
Creativity often sparks when an inventor, examining existing ideas, sees a way to combine them with a novel twist~\cite{Warr2005}.
% Creativity often sparks when the inventor sees a way to combine existing ideas with a novel twist~\cite{Warr2005}.
An environment rich with \emph{examples} is fuel for this fire. In industrial and graphic design \cite{Buxton2007,Herring2009} their use improves process and final results~\cite{Dow2011,Lee2010a}.
%Examples are critical to provide inspiration, guidance, and inform design \cite{Herring2009,Buxton2007}; for example,
%%In other fields of design, designers clip, store, and display examples for inspiration \cite{Buxton2007}.
%industrial designers collect various knobs and materials, and web designers bookmark sites \cite{Herring2009}.
%Managing these examples effectively is already a significant task even in these more visual fields, but there is no explicit support for vibrotactile (VT) design.
%I will investigate interaction techniques to directly use examples in haptic design through a design gallery tool for VT icons (\autoref{hapticexamples:designgallerysketch}).
Design galleries are used in graphics and web design to facilitate the use of examples \cite{Lee2010a,Marks1997}.
While there are several challenges involved with examples in design, including capture, search, management, use, and sharing, I limit this project's scope to the \emph{combining} existing examples to create new VT icons.

Problem preparation -- also known as the ``problem setting" \cite{Schon1982} or ``analysis of problem"~\cite{Warr2005}
%\osC{or ``collect"~\cite{Shneiderman2000}} 
step of design -- involves 
% getting a handle on the problem 
immersion in the challenge
and drawing inspiration from previous work. %, and and establishing a first general approach with which to attempt a solution.
%Sch\"{o}n demonstrated that designers initially frame their problems before developing a solution \cite{Schon1982}.
%Sch\"{o}n also describes the designer's repertoire, their collected experience, which aids in design.
Both may come from the designer's experience,  \emph{repertoire}~\cite{Schon1982} or exposure to a symbolic domain, e.g., mathematical theorems and notation %, or techniques for painting
\cite{Csikszentmihalyi1996}.

To this end, external examples are critical in inspiring, guiding and informing design \cite{Herring2009,Buxton2007}. 
Industrial designers collect objects %various knobs
and materials; web designers bookmark sites \cite{Herring2009}.
In graphics and web design, \emph{design galleries} organize examples to be  immediately at hand % in the design process
~\cite{Lee2010a,Marks1997}.
% \emph{Design galleries}  are used in graphics and web design to include examples immediately at hand in the design process~\cite{Lee2010a,Marks1997}.
Example-based tools often use sophisticated techniques to mix and match styles and content~\cite{Kumar2011}: this requires immediate access to the examples' underlying structure.

Several effect libraries are available to designers of vibrotactile (VT) sensations, e.g., for accessible wayfinding \cite{Zelek2003} or % rich 
media experiences \cite{SchneiderAsiaHaptics2014,Israr2014,ImmersionCorporation,Culbertson2014}. 
%\kmC{slc} % leave out Seifi2015? since it does not have all these limitations. use as positive example instead?
But despite the need for effect customizability~\cite{Seifi2014}, VT library elements are generally opaque in construction and immutable.
Recent advances include limited parameter adjustability~\cite{Israr2014,SchneiderAsiaHaptics2014} and faceted library search and browsing~\cite{Seifi2015}. 
Despite this, designers still must either choose a pre-existing sensation or build from scratch:
\textit{elements cannot be sampled, recombined, built upon or adapted}. %imitated with variations.
In contrast, web designers can access a page's source;
graphic and sound designers can sample and incorporate colours and sounds from other media.

Here, we \textit{examine the potential role of examples} in VT design, to establish how to best support their use.
% Here, we examine the role of examples in VT design.
We designed a web-based editor and interactive \emph{design gallery} \cite{Lee2010a,Marks1997} (\autoref{fig:macaron:hi}) for VT sensations,
then asked users to compare versions (\autoref{fig:versions}) that vary in example accessibility via \emph{visibility} and \emph{incorporability}, as they create VT effects for animations (\autoref{fig:animation}).
%\kmC{adequate grounding of this choice? slc} % KM 11.07 1227 as I come back later to these terms (in tool variant choice, then results) I realized there is not a lot of justification for choosing these dimensions. I think we had really good reasons for going this way, but it doesn't come across.

%We then compare versions of this tool which vary in power of examples use: the editor alone, relative to designer access to examples with low or high \emph{visibility} and low or high \emph{composability}.
Analysis of user action logs provide an objective picture of the VT design process. To validate the deployment of this methodology at scale, we also interpret and validate logs with direct observation and interviews.
%Specifically, we:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item introduce \textit{Macaron}, a web-based VT effect editor through which examples can be used directly in designs,
%\item find that \textit{visible, incorporable examples make design easier} by providing a starting point for design and scaffolding to learn how to work with VT parameters,
%\item identify \textit{implications for future tools and libraries}, and
%\item discuss the \textit{opportunities afforded by a web-based editor} as a practical tool and platform for studying other aspects of VT design at scale.

%\subsection{Salient factors in VT effect perception and control}
%% Haptic icons  have long been an important tool for structuring vibrotactile design, typically manipulated with amplitude, frequency and waveform~\cite{Gunther2002,MacLean2003,Brewster2004,maclean2008foundations}.
%Vibrotactile effects (e.g. haptic icons~\cite{MacLean2003}) are typically manipulated with low-level engineering of signal parameters, beginning with  amplitude, frequency and waveform~\cite{Gunther2002,MacLean2003,Brewster2004,maclean2008foundations}.
%%
%%Different granularities of amplitude and frequency control show that
%Rhythm can support large, learnable icon sets \cite{Ternes2008,Swerdfeger2009a};  combining waveforms enhances roughness \cite{GunhyukPark2011}.
%Time-varying amplitude adds musical expressivity, from tactile crescendos \cite{Brown2006} to 
%%attack-decay-sustain-release (ADSR)
%envelopes \cite{Schneider2014}.
%Multi-dimensional scaling % (MDS)
%can be used to identify %, confirm, 
%and elaborate these parameters \cite{MacLean2003,VanErp2003,Enriquez2006,Hollins2000}.
%
%Affect and metaphor are another way to structure and manipulate sensations at a level more cognitively relevant than engineering parameters.
%Perceived valence (pleasantness) and arousal can be influenced by  frequency/amplitude combination \cite{YongjaeYoo2015,Obrist2015}.
%Metaphors \cite{chan2008,Obrist2013,Seifi2015} and use cases \cite{chan2008,Seifi2015} offer structure, memorability and design language.
%% While we focus here on single-actuator displays, 
%Spatial displays require additional controls for location and direction, % for users to work with, 
%whether body-scale \cite{Gunther2002,Israr2011a}, mobile  \cite{Seo2013}, or mid-air \cite{Obrist2015}.
%While many parameters are available for VT design, we chose the most established (time-varying frequency and amplitude) for Macaron's initial implementation.
%%Location and direction also influence affective perception \cite{Obrist2015}.
%%\kmC{summarize? slc} % KM 11.07 1143 this section needs a brief capture statement. My rework of ss heading helps, but problem is,  you've listed a ton of parameters, but not said how this relates to Macaron. This would be a place to say "we chose the three most basic ones to start exploring these ideas (freq, amp, time invariance), but clearly there's a lot of headroom to bring in other manipulables in the future?
%
%%\begin{itemize}
%
%%\item (briefly) what parameters today's technology gives control discretion over, and the scale at which these play out (temporal granularity? thinking about difference between amplitude and rhythm). Mention technology insofar as to say ``this is what the tech requires you to control; and this is what people perceive as perceptual dimensions that thus should be controlled''.
%
%%\item what parameters have been found to have expressive benefit (rhythm wins, waveform loses). Emotional parameters (Sri, Seifi)
%
%
%%\item what expressive control entails. Focus here on the stimulus properties and their perception, not the tools used to draw them out.
%
%%\item while design space is certainly more limited than visual and auditory design, a considerable and expressive freedom exists (e.g. Ternes, Swerdfeger thesis - pretty large sets are learnable). 
%
%%\osC{missing some synthesis, slc} %KM: I haven't been able to fully process or express what you've suggested here
%%\item what makes it hard to access the expressivity that does exist is: 
%%(a) serial nature that can be hard for an editor to represent in overview and in comparison with alternatives (a challenge faced by other temporal-media editors) 
%%(b) poor predictability of how superposed dimensions (e.g. tracks) will interact perceptually (?)
%%(c) big problem: machine parameters aren't necessarily the right perceptual parameters [but, this isn't quite the one you're going after here] 
%
%%(d) ``blank sheet'' problem - perennially needing to start from scratch - identify as the one you're focusing on here.
%
%
%%\end{itemize}
%
%
%%\noindent Fodder: 
%
%%- Amplitude and frequency are identified as the primary low-level design parameters for single-location VT actuators \cite{Gunther2002,Schneider2014}.
% 
% %- rhythm and other time-invariant patterns occur at a different scale; perceptually extremely important -  Mention van Erp 2003, Brown 2006, Ternes 2008
%
%%- Waveform less expressive \cite{Gunther2002}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\subsection{Past approaches to VT design}
%% Several tools have been built to aid VT design.
%Past editors -- e.g., the Hapticon Editor \cite{Enriquez2003}, Haptic Icon Prototyper \cite{Swindells2006}, posVibEditor \cite{Ryu2008}, Vivitouch Studio \cite{Swindells2014}, and Haptic Studio (www.immersion.com) -- are track-based, with graphical representations to edit either waveforms or profiles of dynamic parameters.
%Additional features (e.g., spatial control or mobile interfaces) are surveyed in \cite{Schneider2015}.
%%Features include the combination or multi-tracking of effects, utilizing a library of existing effects, and the ability to play back sensations.
%
%A library of effects is critical for haptic design tools \cite{Schneider2015}. Most existing tools support feature saving/loading, and some have an internal component library \cite{Enriquez2003,Swindells2006,Swindells2014}.
%However, previous implementations were primarily \emph{compositional}, employing building blocks~\cite{Enriquez2006} %that can be combined to create more complex sensations \cite{Enriquez2006}.
%rather than complete artifacts. Example use was not studied.
%%In Macaron, we also investigate examples of full, created and complete artifacts, built right into the tool.
%%\kmC{careful/confused slc} 
%% in this par you seem to be saying existing libraries only have bits, not full things. [caution: Swindells examples allowed for examples to be complete as well as partial. I'd back off on this.]
%% in next par, you seem to say the opposite: libraries only have whole examples, you can't pick and choose from internals. 
%
%%This  \kmC{what is??} is more analogous to 
%% Complete artifacts are found in large libraries of VT icons, but with limitations.
%Large VT libraries contain complete artifacts, but impose a serious constraint on their use.
%In the Immersion Touch Effects Studio library,
%% of tactile icons supplied on a mobile platform, but 
%underlying structure and design parameters are hidden and cannot be incorporated into new designs. %, and examples cannot be incorporated into a new project.
%VibViz \cite{Seifi2015} features 120 VT examples with visualizations searchable by several taxonomies, but the selection model is all-or-nothing.
%FeelCraft \cite{SchneiderAsiaHaptics2014} proposes a community-driven library of feel effects \cite{Israr2014} for simple parametric customization and re-use. %\kmC{and?} % how does Feelcraft fit in here? are you talking about FC in next sentence? if so, need to connect end-user customization better to FC.
%While end user customization-by-selection is important \cite{Seifi2014},  
%experts need a more open, editable model,
%% we suggest a more open model for experts. %this \kmC{what?} still represents a library of selectable, all-or-nothing designs.
%%Compare this to
%% For example, web designers can view source code at any time, with recent tools allowing search and easy incorporation of elements
%just as web designers rely on full access to source code with recent tools allowing search and easy incorporation % of elements
%% interactive \emph{design galleries} allow users to search and incorporate elements from other sites

%% ALSO, this section seems a little long >.25/6 pgs+ 8-10 refs - although it is likely most impt part of RW, consider dropping one or two cases.
%
%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item Other editors have had some success in going after "what makes VT design hard''. They've introduced track-based design, exposed underlying parameters, helped with rapid prototyping, visualization, and sharing of sensations. They vary in the degree to which they support``choosing'' vs ``modifying'' (use Seifi terminology) and how they expose innards. 
%
%% \item Past use of examples goes this far: Swindells allows things to be saved and re-used (but not sampled, and only used in narrow ways), VibViz allows library browsing but doesn't show underlying construction (well, a bit). Immersion editor...
%
%% \item Here, we aren't so much introducing new features or abilities, but we want to turn the knob on the ``example'' thing to see how it actually impacts the design process.  [i.e., don't claim that Macaron is first to employ examples. But do say that it is novel to study it in a variable way]

To investigate VT design in the context of examples, we required a platform that would expose users' natural procedural tendencies. 
Our Macaron design gallery is simple, flexible, and extensible.
In this work, we add multiple types of example access to polished implementations of familiar concepts: \emph{tracks}, \emph{envelopes}, and \emph{keyframes}
(Figures~\ref{fig:macaron:hi},\ref{fig:versions}).
This enables easy extensions to other devices, discussed in \autoref{ch:applications}.

\emph{Tracks} are the accepted language of temporal media editors (video, audio, and past haptic efforts \cite{Swindells2006,Enriquez2003,Ryu2008}).
We provide tracks for perceptually important ``textural'' parameters (amplitude and frequency); the user accesses periodic and time-variant aspects by manipulating their 
\emph{envelopes} using
%Effects are further encapsulated as 
\emph{keyframes}, with linear interpolation in-between.
Users double-click to create a new keyframe, click or drag a box to select, and change or delete a selection by dragging or with the keyboard.
A waveform visualization reflects changes.

Macaron's example access features are inspired by more recent graphics and web design galleries \cite{Marks1997,Lee2010a,Ritchie2011}, which show examples side-by-side with the editor.
% to help ground the designer.
Other implemented features, critical for polished creative control \cite{Schneider2015}, include real-time playback, time control (scrubbing) % by the red play-bar, 
copy-and-paste, undo and redo, and muting (disables realtime VT output).
% Users can mute vibration output. 
%
To support its use as an experimental tool, user interactions are logged; 
start / stop buttons allow the user to indicate when they began and completed their design process.

 
Macaron was built with HTML5 and JavaScript, using React, Reflux, D3, and
Audiolet\footnote{\url{facebook.github.io/react}, \url{github.com/reflux}, \url{d3js.org}, \url{github.com/oampo/Audiolet}}. Real-time sound synthesis drove a C2 actuator.
To leave % the user's 
hands free for keyboard and mouse, the C2 is attached to a wristband; we simulate the design process for a wrist-worn wearable (as in \cite{Seifi2015}).

element \emph{incorporability} and internal parameter \emph{visibility} (\autoref{fig:versions}, \autoref{tab:toolAlternatives}).
We hypothesized these would affect users' design processes, e.g., incorporable examples would encourage ``mixing and matching" of examples, visibility might provide insight.
%\kmC{OS: slc} % reads very oddly to have this results-type sentence here. Recall a discussion, can't remember reasoning. Can we drop it?
%However, these different versions revealed that our participants used these examples in a more nuanced way: as a \emph{starting point for each design}, and \emph{scaffolding for learning}.
%Our results indicated this nuanced.

%We discuss this later. %  finding not quite lining up with these dimensions.
%We theorize that the first, which opens the ``black box'' that is closed in most example libraries, will assist learning, encourage deconstruction, and promote internally intensive strategies like superposition (e.g., modifying envelopes of individual tracks as opposed to just pasting together frames sequentially). 
%Incorporability, on the other hand, should promote re-usability and efficiency, but it might not necessarily improve learning or sophisticated editing methods.

We compared these versions with each other and with a non-example version:

% \section{Study Method}
%\kmC{slc} % OS, I don't like my new section title much. Can you do better? I want to allude to what the study is about, to avoid natural assumption it's for tool usability.
Participants were tasked with creating a sensation to accompany five animations (\autoref{fig:animation}) -- SVGs (scalable vector graphics)  which can be played or scrubbed by the same means as navigating Macaron's time control.
We chose animation variety (concrete to abstract) and complexity to inspire non-obvious solutions without overwhelming.

Participants were first trained on \none\ with no animation,
then presented with five animation/version combinations.
As the least crucial source of variance, animations were presented in \autoref{fig:animation}'s constant order, while 
interface versions were counterbalanced in two 5x5 Latin square designs.
Thus, each participant encountered each animation and each interface version once; over all participants, each animation/version combination appeared twice,
with Latin squares balancing 1st-order carry-over effects.
This design confounds learning with animation task. 
We believe this is an acceptable tradeoff at this stage, allowing us balance interface order with a single participant session of reasonable length (1-1.5h).
% Once we understand the effect of example interfaces, we can choose a single version and examine other factors in future work.


% I come out of this feeling confused about factors and rationale.
% - explicitly state the factors you KEPT (incorporability and visibility) and the one you dropped.  
% - Why can you afford to overlook learning?
% - define what you got, for the price of the confound: be explicit about the constraint being satisfied.  there is both fitting a session into a single subject's time, and not choosing to run more subjects to keep the design iteration lightweight in proportion to the investigative stage.

% 1. earlier you called them "designers" - might require qualification.

% 2. Later you mix in "I" with "P" subjects. I think (not sure) that you ran 13 subjects, but discarded 3 incompletes. This is a confusing way to say it; when you first identify the incompletes, along with P9, I can't tell what's what. Is it P1-P10 plus I1-I3? Indicate this right here where you identify subjects.
%
% 3. Better justify N=10. Later, it gets awkward when you note you only have 2 observations each. We know people will ask for more data; I don't think what's here is strong enough to counter. Need to indicate the COST of running a subject? relative to benefit? 20 would not be an unusual number for a psychophysics experiment. The point here is the analysis is hell. 

We targeted a study size of 10 complete participants for a balanced Latin square design, and a manageable sample size for rich, exploratory, qualitative analysis. % for an exploratory investigation.
13 untrained  participants were recruited: P1-10  (7 female, ages 22-35) completed all five tasks, while I1-3 (2 female, ages 29-45)

only completed the first three % (heartbeat, cat, lightning) 
due to time restrictions.
% This may be due
Because I1-3 (and P9) all had the same interface order (\lo, \none, \vis, \hi, \select), we suspect that beginning with `sparse' versions gave insufficient insight into how to design quickly enough to finish the study. % into how to use examples.
I1-3 showed no distinct patterns beyond this; we leave their data for future analysis.

%
%\kmC{slc} % I'm trying sticking this part about participants under "analysis", rather than as part of what looks like a usability comment. I believe you're not attributing the noncompletion to a lack of tool usability, but rather to task comprehension. But generally, the following statements are confusing and need to make a point more clearly.
%For each condition, participants were able to complete all 5 designs within their sessions, \kmC{[?? slc]  
%with one exception: three participants ran out of time, failing to finish all of P9's condition before P9 finally did.}
% P9 is one participant not 3. What does it mean that 3 (out of 10, this is not an exception it's a major proportion) failed to finish P9's condition before P9 did?  And how do the I1-3's count re latin square? 


\emph{Tool Usability:} Overall, the tool was well received, described as \qquote{P1}{easy to use}, \qquote{P5}{well made}, %\qquote{P7}{cool}, %\qquote{P7}{awesome},
\qquote{P9}{pretty neat}, \qquote{P3}{the templates help a lot}.

\inlineHeading{Different paths through the interface}
% \subsection{Paths through the Interface}
%
% Participants navigated through the interface in different ways.
% We found three strategies that have later implications for design:
% by time, by component, and by track.
% With by time (\autoref{fig:path:bytime}, P1,2,3,4,7,9), participants march through the design, creating amplitude and frequency at the same time.
% With by component (\autoref{fig:path:bycomponent}, P1,4,6,8,10), participants develop and iterate on part of a design, then repeat or copy and paste the component later in time.
% With by track (\autoref{fig:path:bytrack}, P2,3,6,7,8,9,10), participants work through an entire track (typically amplitude) before working through the other one.
% These different strategies are often combined; for example, P6 developed their car/\lo component by track (amplitude, then frequency).
%
%% Further enforcing flexibility, participants frequently used copy and paste to replicate points in time (containing points from one or both tracks), but P1,3,7 also brought up being able to copy and paste between tracks:
%% \qquote{P7}{The one thing I found missing was copy and pasting between amplitude and frequency}.
%    % Participants navigated through the interface in different ways. 
%
%
    We saw three design-path strategies. % that have later implications for design:  %  time,  by component,  and by track.\\
    \par -- \emph{Time} (\autoref{fig:path:bytime};  P1,2,3,4,7,9): proceed through the timeline,  creating  amplitude  and  frequency  at  the  same  time.
    \par -- \emph{Component} (\autoref{fig:path:bycomponent}, P1,4,6,8,10): iterate  on  a  design element,  then  repeat  or  copy/paste it later in time.
    \par -- \emph{Track} (\autoref{fig:path:bytrack},  P2,3,6,7,8-10): proceed through one entire \emph{track} (typically amplitude), then the other one. 
    
 \noindent Strategies were often combined hierarchically. P6 developed a car/\lo component by track (amplitude, then frequency).
    Wanting additional flexibility,   %participants  used copy/paste to replicate points in time (re-using points from one or both tracks),  but 
    P1,3,7  requested  copy/paste  \emph{between}  tracks: \qquote{P7}{The  one  thing  I found missing was copy and pasting between amplitude and frequency}.

    A common technique (\autoref{fig:path:bytime}b) was to use the red playhead like a plumb-line to align keyframes with animation features (P1-5,7,9,10) and between the two tracks (amplitude and frequency) (P3-5,7,9,10): \qquote{P2}{Using that red arrow thing and placing the dots when it makes the heartbeat}.
    Some participants, including those who used the plumb-line, requested
    %P1,2,6,7,8,9
    %Six participants requested even 
    more refined alignment features: \qquote{P1}{I couldn't keep it straight}. %\textbf{CONFIRM!} \kmC{slc} % Were requestors the same ones who made use of plumbline, or were they ones who hadn't discovered it? i.e. was plubmline enough?
    % Several participants requested alignment features: shift to move in only one of x or y; anchors; alignment of video.

    Copy/paste was used for improved  work efficiency (especially helpful during initial layout or when creating long or repeating designs)
    %\qquote{P1}{If you want to create something that's longer you might want copy and paste},
    %\qquote{P2}{It was easier to use the examples, and it felt like matched, not exactly, but enough}.
%    \qquote{P6}{That was easy, I just copy and pasted the entire thing}.
    and precision:
    \qquote{P6}{Copy and paste...was also the most precise, because if you feel like it's a perfect fit, you can use it exactly}.
    Correspondingly, conditions without copy/paste (\emph{i.e.}, \lo and \vis) took additional effort:
    % \qquote{P5}{It's harder than the previous ones because there's no copy and paste}.
    \qquote{P5}{It's harder...because there's no copy and paste}.
%    \qquote{P6}{That was a little tedious}.
    %Indeed, even 
%    Power features (e.g., keyframe typing) were used mainly for alignment: \qquote{P1}{maybe, if I want to align stuff}.
    Precision also depended on context: %\qquote{P9}{If it was used for monitoring someone's health, you would have to be very accurate}.
    \qquote{P9}{For monitoring someone's health, you would have to be very accurate}
    %, \qquote{P4}{I find [copy and paste] to be a useful but not priority functionality for me...I feel like vibration is less precise compared to vision}. % because I don't know if it's right or wrong, but I feel like vibration is less precise compared to vision}.

    

	%Ã¢ÂÂ	Copy and paste was often cited making things easier and less tedious, especially for larger tasks. Speed: less mentioned, but related, was that copy and paste sped up the process. Precision: Because c+p exactly replicated the source material, it was described as more precise.. This is interesting because P4 said copy and paste was less important to her, but thatÃ¢ÂÂs because she considered vibration to be less accurate than other modalities (connected to the gist/focus or prefeel/render). Precision is also connected to other features: alignment (which subsumes entering values), purpose of the design (medical vs. toy P9)
	%Ã¢ÂÂ	Several participants requested alignment features: shift to move in only one of x or y; anchors; alignment of video. Participants also described one major approach aligning their vibrations to events in the animation. This is consistent with our observations; we saw several participants use the read playhead to both line up keyframes with video events, and to align keyframes between amplitude and frequency.


\inlineHeading{Editing and playback}
During iteration, participants edited in bursts of primarily scrubbing activity, bookended by full playthroughs.
They took time to realize each new version of the design before observing an overview.
            	% While the mute feature was rarely used, [KM: but, 3/7 did. That's not rare.}

If that's so (not sure) then is this section about scrubbing during focus work (as a strategy that M supports, but only some people liked) or about focus vs overview switching seen in everyone?
   		When editing, participants scrubbed back-and-forth, varying speed (P1-4,7,9,10), and dragging keyframes to try ideas out (P1,3,4,7,9,10) \autoref{fig:realtimefeedback}.
    This feature was valued by those who used it: \qquote{P1}{The real-time part is pretty important};
%\qquote{P1}{When I adjust it I can feel how it changes, the real-time part is pretty important};
    some rarely played, showing more frequent or longer periods of scrubbing instead (P2,9,10).
    %P2 had difficulty working with frequency until the researcher suggested trying it: \qquote{P2}{Ah, okay, the vibration disappears at a higher frequency}.
    Others rarely scrubbed (P5, P8), possibly to have an overall sense of the design: \qquote{P8}{Trying to get a general sense of how it might feel}.
%    P5 only scrubbed back-and-forth when reminded of the tool's capability in their cat condition; %, but did not continue to do this afterwards, and did not try out keyframe values in a focused way.

    %P4 remarked on target of focus: \qquote{P4}{I was mostly creating it by looking at the animation, so during creating I didn't really try it out a lot}.
            	P3, P4, and P7 all exhibited focused editing with mute enabled, unmuting for the bookended play sections; others did not use muting.

\inlineHeading{Encoding and Framing}
%\kmC{SLC - Examples?} % [02.02] Can we bring this back to examples more?
% [pre-submission] the encoding thing seems potentially very important, and not really focused on here. Maybe highlight in future work. Can examples, or simply encoding matches between haptics and other modalities, help us understand natural mappings or translations between modalities? 
    % Participants had different strategies when tackling their designs.
    Some participants encoded parameters using consistent rules, often aligned to events like heartbeats or lightning bolts.
    Others sought to create moods or metaphors for sensation.
    
   Encoding %\kmC{SLC} % What (which of previous two strategies) was visible? It sounds like all examples of consistent rules (but crashes on lightning strikes could also be metaphor, but that would make it a combined strategy). Do you have other examples of mood/metaphor? 
   was most visible in the lightning task, where participants represented lightning bolts in regular ways: %with pulses of consistent height:
   %, sometimes representing left and right lightning strikes differently (different heights or shapes):
   \qquote{P9}{if there was a lightning bolt on the left, I put amplitude and frequency a little longer than a lightning bolt on the right}.
   When the animation had two simultaneous bolts, several (P2-4,7,9) encoded it by superimposing two bolt representations on top of one another.
   Participants were forced to reframe their encoding strategy:
   \qquote{P7}{...two [lightning bolts]...I divided it into two equal partitions, .6 and 1}.
%   \qquote{P7}{...two [lightning bolts] at one particular snapshot, that is why I divided it into two equal partitions, .6 and 1},
%   \qquote{P9}{if there were two bolts I tried to make double amplitude and frequency but I ran out of space}.
   
%   Encoded designs varied, either encoded in shape or in parameters.
%   We often observed frequency mirroring amplitude (as observed in \autoref{} and \autoref{}.
%   Sometimes, the two were developed in concert, somewhat mirrored and sometimes varied (as in \autoref{}).
%   Finally, sometimes parameters encoded different features.
%   P1 used amplitude to represent the bumpiness of the car, and frequency to represent the turns.
   
   Encoding failed when participants did not find a direct mapping:
   %\qquote{P9}{Normally you don't think of snowflakes in terms of vibrations},
      %P7 couldn't resolve representing three snowflakes with two parameter tracks: 
      \qquote{P7}{When the three [snow flakes] come together I think my strategy broke down}. %, because there are only two choices, amplitude and frequency}.
%   \qquote{P2}{it felt like the snowflakes were going in a wave}.
   Metaphors helped in these cases.
   Car took extra imagination, either for the experience of driving (P6, P8, and P9 didn't drive), %, but designed for what they imagined),
   %it to be like;
   or because it's hard to %P1 knew what it felt like to drive, but didn't
   \qquote{P1}{know what it would feel like on the wrist}. %\kmC{SLC} % so what did they do? was this then a failure? Did they divert to a metaphor/mood approach? If so, would a general approach be: first try to encode, if that fails try a metaphor/mood? 
   %
%   There was a strong tendency to ``focus on the visual" task:  P2, P4, P7, P8. 
   %
%   We do not yet know if this was due to abstractness of the sensation, the slower speed, or amount of features present in the animation.
%   More general metaphors were used instead of a direct encoding.
   P6 describes her process for both lightning and snow as using mood: \qquote{P6}{...what I think the mood is...like snow fall, it's kinda like, very gentle and calm}.
   

   

   
	%Ã¢ÂÂ	Some participants, however, did not focus on alignment in their designs, instead focusing on general impressions to create a Ã¢ÂÂmoodÃ¢ÂÂ. [connect to focus/gist above?] [connect to framing and metaphor below?]
	%Ã¢ÂÂ	ENCODING???
	%Ã¢ÂÂ	Participants demonstrated framing, structuring the problem to find an appropriate tack to continue. In accordance with SchÃÂ¶nÃ¢ÂÂs theory of Ã¢ÂÂseeing the problem in familiar termsÃ¢ÂÂ, participants often drew parallels with earlier tasks:

\subsection{Implications for Design}
    
    %Expose examples
    \subsubsection{Expose example structures for learning}
    When exposed to examples' underlying structure, participants are able to build their repertoire and learn VT design conventions like \qquote{P9}{big shapes}.
    %\kmC??: conventions (quote about using big shapes)}.
    Such scaffolding is particularly crucial in an environment where experienced VT designers and training possibilities are rare. % , typically available only at select universities.
    Whether through exploratory tool use or structured with online training programs, examples can expand the VT design practices available to novice designers.
    
    %templates
    \inlineHeading{Examples as templates}
    Participants typically copied an example first before iterating and customizing,

    % 3However, more powerful recommendation tools should not compromise context.
    Participants often repeated gallery searches for each new animation; they needed to compare examples alongside the target graphic.

    Clarifying the context for each example, by presenting it either in connection to its original design goal or as a candidate for the participant's current goal, will help participants choose an example.

    \inlineHeading{Hideable examples}
    Some participants wanted to be individualistic with their designs and actively disliked the most powerful \hi condition, saying that the \none condition was cleaner, or that while examples were helpful to learn, they felt ``more creative" with fewer examples present.
%    A simple solution to this design problem could be
    A hideable gallery, which can be opened when needed but kept hidden otherwise, could accommodate user preference.
    %This capability could also be personalized, where participants could intentionally restrict visibility or incorporability.

% Implications for VT Design

% \subsection{Implications for VT Design Tools}
    
    % Prefeel
    \inlineHeading{Realtime ``prefeel" then render} % Prefeel and Render}
    Macaron's real-time feedback supported exploration, with full play-throughs providing an overview or  evaluation in-between editing sessions.
    %Participants typically worked in focused, sustained bursts that included real-time experimentation: scrubbing and keyframe modification. %\kmC{SLC} %% What is 'movement of keyframes'?
    %This exploratory editing was typically bookended by full play-throughs of animation and vibration.
    %This suggests that real-time exploration was important in focused work, and full play-throughs important for an overall view.
    %\kmC{SLCx2} 
    % 1. Not following. Do the full play-throughs indicate that the real-time scrubbing was not necessary? How does that follow? 
    % 
    % ** 2. Below it sounds like in contrast, you're saying that the pre-feel is pretty important. I'm confused about the overall point of this section.** 
    In addition, P4, who was familiar with haptics, felt that the scrubbing synthesis  was ``muddy" relative to waveforms pre-rendered with audio tools -- a common challenge, noted also by the researchers but deemed suitable for this study.
    %
    % Because real-time synthesis sometimes falls short compared to rendered sensations,     this process suggests a feedback model based on 
    While we hope this technology deficit inspires improved realtime rendering algorithms, it also suggests an explicit workflow compromise.
    Many video editing and compositing tools show a low-resolution previsualization in design mode; a clip is then fully rendered for playback.
    For tactile design, coarse, ``prefeel" sensations would be synthesized for immediate feedback during a rough design stage, and a high-fidelity rendering generated for less frequent play-throughs.
    This %may have marginal gains for a short, vibration-based editing, but could pay off when using 
    could help computationally demanding, perceptually-based models or multi-actuator setups (e.g., tactile animation \cite{Schneider2015} as a prefeel for tactile brush \cite{Israr2011a}).

    % Wide Walls
    \inlineHeading{Tool flexibility}
    Macaron was used in very different ways depending on the participant.
    % % Multiple Avenues
    % \subsubsection{Multiple Avenues}
    %In particular, participants had two strategies for developing their design: by track, by working with amplitude exclusively, then with frequency exclusively; and by time, by working with amplitude and frequency in tandem, marching along time or copying and pasting to repeat a designed example.
    Some progressed by time, by track, by component, or a combination thereof.
    Some mirrored  frequency and amplitude, using them together, while others used them to express different ideas. % (P1 used frequency to express rumbling in the car animation, and frequency to express turning).
    This suggests that tools should be flexible and accommodate different strategies; perhaps offering a choice to group by parameters (e.g., \cite{Schneider2015}) or work along parameter tracks (e.g., \cite{Swindells2014,Swindells2006}).
    
    % Alignment
    \inlineHeading{Alignment tools}
   %\osC{Combine this with Reuse and maybe Wide walls into a more general, ``give the designers more options and more power with tools" discussion}
    Participants frequently used the playhead for alignment, finding locations in the video or aligning points between amplitude and frequency.
    Participants requested using modifier keys to align points (as in other editing tools), or a visualization of events in video.
    This suggests several features, providing ability to:
        \par -- Align comparison sensations from each modality - visual or audio sensation alongside VT. %\osC{-- e.g.,  using one, or linked source documents.}
        \par -- Place anchors for attaching a VT sensation (or keyframe within it) to a point in a target visual or audio sensation. This might be automatically assisted, e.g, with video analysis techniques to find scene changes.
        \par -- Automatically align keyframes to nearby keyframes, or use a modifier key to constrain or nudge keyframe movement.
    
    % Reuse
    \inlineHeading{Reuse}
    Copy/paste, especially from a template, speeded  design and facilitated otherwise tedious approaches.
    Several participants made use of element repetition, which had to be re-done upon design re-framing.
    While copy/paste was helpful, more powerful repetition tools (e.g. looping, and ``master templates'', as in PowerPoint) would likely find use by many designers.
    
    % Automated encoding
    \inlineHeading{Automated Encoding}
    Some participants applied consistent rules in translating an animation to a tactile rendering -- e.g., representing left/right lightning bolts differently in the lightning animation, or directly matching amplitude to up-down motion in the car animation.
    Some of these practices might be automated into generative rules. 
    For example, video analysis could detect up/down motion for a visual object, and translate that automatically to a level for amplitude, similar to how motion trackers can track a moving object and link that to position of an animation; or, a designer might want to specify the mapping.
    More complex parameterizations could provide a useful tool for expert users, much like how {\tt fmod} allows for parametrized audio in game design.

\inlineHeading{Study factors}
%However, its limitations show an obvious path to next steps. 
%Study size was constrained by the resource demands of our qualitative methods: we analyzed only 10 participants' design experiences.
% Only 10 people participated in this study; the three incomplete participants were not analyzed, which we plan to do to identify questions for future studies.
Our Latin square design allowed qualitative comparison of several gallery variants, but did not have the power for comparative statistical tests between the alternatives.
Meanwhile, five design tasks presented in a uniform order did not permit systematic insights into other factors: learning, or task features such as abstractness and complexity.
Flow was identified after-the-fact as an important framework for future analysis, but only after our study was designed and data was collected.


Our proposed example-usage dimensions of visibility and incorporability were a useful starting point, but did not line up well with the task processes that people actually used with Macaron. We did see behaviors that aligned well with \emph{learning} and \emph{design-starting} from examples, as well as hints of a more  rich and nuanced view of what makes examples useful and in what way.

First, the examples-as-starting-point strategies actually used (\autoref{tab:direct:example:strategies}) suggest that visibility and incorporability at minimum are not quite right and probably insufficient in dimensionality -- there is a concept of edibility regardless of starting point; whereas incorporability could entail editing, but certainly requires an example as a start.

Additionally, observations (including details not reported due to space limits) suggest other factors that influence example use, e.g., 
 \emph{difficulty}, from task, interface and personal confidence and experience; and
 \emph{task}, from task complexity and abstraction, user strategy, e.g. encoding and metaphor, and user confidence and experience. 
These hints are far from orthogonal, and will require further research, with focus turned to elements like task abstraction and user background, to disentangle and prioritize. 

\inlineHeading{Online deployment}
Triangulation will be helpful in studying factors like difficulty, task abstraction, and user background.
In this study, Macaron was deployed and studied locally.
We were able to validate the editor's design support and utility of its logging methods, and expose many interesting insights into natural end-user design practices.

Our next plan to answer these questions is to deploy Macaron at a larger scale: online, as a free-to-use design tool for the haptics community, with an initial study in haptics courses.
This will allow research \emph{in-situ} with larger, more quantitative, remote-based methods for data collection, triangulated with the less scalable qualitative methods used in-lab.
Interaction logs, use statistics, and A/B tests will help us further develop Macaron as  a tool for VT design and more generally as a lens for the haptic design process.
\osC{TODO: Comment more on the Online Deployment, probably as its own section, and with image of the demo and current directions. Also need to show MacaronKits.}
